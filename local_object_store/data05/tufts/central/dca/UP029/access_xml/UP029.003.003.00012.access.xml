Williams was found guilty

~orsigianthen proceeded
to discussthe issue_ of corp

cited the case of the Dalkon
Shield IVD, which was taken
off the market in 197~for
producing a high incidence
of infections that led to
miscarriages. Recently,

know that the Pi11 ann IUD
are not the only effective
methods. She added that
the condom and foam used
together are just as effect 
ive as the Pill.
Nor sigian briefly di s 
cussed the issue of shared
responsibility in birth
control. She stated that
most men still don't feel
it is their duty to worry

attitude. she observed. hin

The next issue that~or&#173;
S.lglan addressed \,as abor 
tion and the Hatch' Amend 
ment. She stated that "con 
trol oyer fertility is con 
trol oyer our liYes." She
added that the issue - of a 
bortion is difficult to dis 
cuss because it is easy for
one to be subjected to wild
epithets such as 'baby kill 
er,' or 'destroyer of the
American family.' Those who
feel this way&#183;, she continued,
don't want to give women
control of their lives. She
added that she is not pes 
simistic about the future
because "feminist lawyers
are doing a great job."
Norsigian reported that
Our Bodies, Ourselves, in
now being revised. She felt
the book has encouraged wo 
men to feel entitled to bet 
el' medical information and
care. She concluded by say 
ing that the political mes 
sage of this book is what
irritates and worries people
who are aga'inst Women's
Ricrhts the most. While
pr~isedby the American Lib 
rary Association and Planned
Parenthood~Our Bodies, Our

ed by the Moral Majority,
which seeks to ban it from
high schools and libraries.
The rev i sed and expanded

scheduled to appear early
in 1953.

used as one of the major
pieces in the actor's reper 
toire for his nationally
known marionette theater.
In the version "with strings
attached," as he jovially
puts i to, Arnott performs
all roles, his classically 
trained voice jumping from
character to character mel 
lifluously and convincingly,
wi thout ever mi ssing a rhy 
thmic beat. He performed
the show at Tufts last year,
has toured it to various
locations throughout the
U.S., and presented it at
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts
last fall in connection with,
the museum I s Greek exhi 
bition "The Search for Alex 
ander. "
Further, the style in
which Greek drama was writ 
ten lends itself to radio
presentation somewhat more
easily than~:;ltemporary
drama because of the physic 
al structures of the Greek
theaters.
"The Greek drama," Arnott
explains, "was written for
theaters radically different
from any now in existence.
They held some 15,000 people
so most of the audience
could see the actors only
as figures about three-quar 
ters of an inch high."
That limitation of visi 
bility meant that Greek dra 
matists could not rely on
the actors to communicate
anything to the audience
through subtle nuances of
The art of the actor is
at once visual and vocal,
and most of the theater ex 
perienced by audiences today

istics in nearly equal pro 
portions. One obvious ex 
l~cptionis the art of the
rad io actor, who must com 
municate' character, action,
plot and motivation using
only the tool of his voice.
Though the art of the radio
actor has become nearly de 
funct since~headvent of
'tt'levision, it is alive and

Boston Opera's "Aida"
an Emotional Experience
Pharohs, Sphinxes, Heroes
and Slaves ruled the stage
last Thursday when the Opera
Company 'of Boston staged
its second season premiere
with a new production of
Aida, by Giuseppe' Verdi.
A full h0use was in attend 
ance, and they witnessed
a spectacle that, despite
minor flaws, contained~ome
wonderful singing and im 
pressive emotional impact.
By far, the standout of
the evening was soprano
Shirley Verrett, who sang
the leading role ofA~da.
A guest in Boston who has
sung in the great opera
houses of the world, Verrett
exercised magnificentcon~
trol spanning her entire
range, from coloratura high
CiS to her deep, rich lower
notes. She also displayed
emotional warmth,as an act 
ress, invoking her audi 
ence's heartfelt sympathies
at all the tragedies that
the story bequeathes her.
Aida concerns an Egyptian
prince, Radamer, who loves
the slave girl Aida but is
ordered to marry the prin 
cess Amneris. Further com 
plications ensue when the
Ethiopian King, Aida's fath 
er, attacks the Phaoroh and
is ultimately captured.
Radamer must choose between
love of state and that of
a woman, and the plotting
and intrigue that develop
are more than worthy of Gen 
eral Hospital.
Though paling in compar 
isonto Verrett, leading
tenor James McCracken gave
a fine performance overall
as Prince Radamer. His im 
portant opening aria, "Heav 
enly Aida," needed a bit
more emphasis, as he'resort 
ed to falsetto when full
voice would have been more
appropriate; however, this
problem' cleared quickly as
the opera progressed. His
singingbeca~equite beauti

atic, even for the opera.

When itc~metime to

he wanted to stay close tl),

harbored hopes of playing/
football for the Jumbos at

too small and White withdrew
into his 'academics. It was
not until his' junior year
that White decided to ap

JOHN WHITE:'
A Story' of Determination
BY BRUCE COHEN
The year was 1972 and
the Tufts basketball team
was coming off of a 1-17
.record~Head coach Tom Pen 
ders knew he had talent with
Reggie Grahem and Willie
Young, but there was some 
thing missing. He didn't
have that floor leader who
could give his .team the dir 
ection it needed. Then one
day he was sitting in his
office when a young man
walked in and said, "I'm
the best guard in the school
and I think I can p'lay for
you." Penders gave him a
chance and the coach was
not .to be disappointed. Not
only would~heyoung man
become the team's captain
the next year but also led
the Jumbo's to a 22-4 record
Wa tching his beat Brand

White thought back to 1972,
and was ,glad that Penders

enough, then I will still
continue to train and run
nationally for three or four
more years. Then I will take
a break and travel around
the world. But as of right
now, nothing is settled,
and I am aiming for the 1984
Olympics."
Tufts is lucky to have
such a dedicated performer
for three more seasons. And
no one should. be surprised
if they hear the name Eric
Poullain being announced
in the 1984 Olympics.
BACCHAE, continued

erything had to be spelled
out in the script, giving
Greek drama what is perceiv 
ed today. as a characteristic
wordiness.
"The characters have to

'they are and how they're
feeling," says Arnott, de 
. scribing what amounts to

since receiving his bachel 
or's, master's and doctor 
al degrees in Greek from
'Oxford University and the
University of Wales-- he
has solved other problems
inherent in the works by
gearing his scripts to
smooth vocal performance.
"The plays were original 
lytranslated to be read,
rather than performed," he
says. "No attention had been
paid to breath control, dif 
ficult combinations of con 
sonants and other problems
of the actor. The existing
translations were stultified
overly reverential."
By contrast, Arnott's
radio performance 'of The
Bacchae, wedged in between
A Tale of Two Cities and
Frankenstein in the excit 
ingly diverse 26-week ser 
ies, promises to be enthral 
ling, no-strings-attached
entertainment.
MONACO, continued
is that theEuro~eanshave
different classes 'for dif 
fereent age groups. Here
you compete against people
four years older than you
are, which reallYlisn' t fair"
He also feels that there
is a big difference between
the teaching techniques in
Europe and America. "The
Americans know less things
than we know in Europe.
Sometimes I tell things a 
bout technique to the coach
that I learned in Europe
and aren't used here. Most _
of the new techniques and
tricks originate in Europe,
so the top Americans have
to be good on their own.
But America has done alot
to further the advancement
of track."
There is one similarity
however, between Europe and
America, and that is the
relative lack of popularity
in track among the general
populace. Says Eric, "It
is rising somewhat in pop-: 
ularity, but the most pop- ,
ular sports are still the
team sports.P~rsonally,
I like track because it's
themo~tnatural of all
since you're running against
yourself. I'm responsible
for either winning or losing
and there is no one to blame
or praise except yourself
if you do not win or if you
do win."
So far, Eric mostly has
been able to praise himself
since arriving at Tufts.
He comp]eted a successful
&#183;half-season by winning the
longjump with a
l
leap of 22' 
4 3/4' at'the New Englands,
despite the fact that he
was very ill during the meet
He was also pleased that

in the 55 yard hurdles, in
which he ended up fifth,

the event.
He foresees continued.
success for himself andth~
team future. "I've got a
good chance to make the
NCAA's next year, and I will
train for the Olympics for
Monaco in 1984. I'll probab

Hardie's school spirit
isn't limited to his track
performances. He also works
