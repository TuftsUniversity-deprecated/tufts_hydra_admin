Over 1,000 students, mainly

and Chris Miller have tre 
mendous potential.
The goalie position will
be expertly manned by co 
captain Capone. Clinton
finds depth at this position
as well, as senior Walsh
is what Clinton terms "a
first-class goaltender."
Unfortunately, because
of the unusual time of our
spring vacation this year,
the Jumbos will not be able
to participate in the annual
tournament in Florida. This
puts Clinton's squad at a
disadvantage, as many of
the teams it plays this year
will make the trip to Flori- .'
,da. The Jumbos won't start&#183; .
their season until March
In the midst of his
team I s preseason condition 
ing, lacrosse coachJ~rry
Clinton looks forward to
a successful 1982 season,
a year in which he would
like to see his "enthusias 
tic and well-developed"
squad improve upon last
year's 7-5 record.
Building around a core
of seven returning seniors
and a solid duo of returning
co-capt~ins,midfielder Neil
Doherty and goalkeeper John
Capone, Clinton also greets
a strong crop .of freshmen
"from good schools with good
programs." Although the
team has been spending most
of its time on conditioning,
Coach Clinton hopes to be
able to begin concentrating
on his new offense andd~-
fense in the ensuing weeks.
'The squad graduated only
one senior from last year's
team and Clinton looks for 
ward to working with several
experienced players this
year. Leading theattack
once again will be Dave
Rabin, Tom Coneys and Huey
Walsh, all returningletter~
men. Adding to this al-
,ready-aggressive offense
will be freshman Todd Lang 
ton, a Prep AII'-American
last year, Rob Granaham and
Tyler Hindermann. Clinton
feels this triQ will add
a great deal of speed and
stickhandling expertise to
the offense, and he hopes
to develop some' new attack
techniqu~sutlizing their
capabilities.
Clinton will also field
a strong group of midfield 
ers this year. Led by Do 
herty, a two-year captain
who, according to Clinton,
is "a smart player who 'can
do just abouteveryth~n~'
out there. " the. f!roup will'
also consist of Rod Campbell
and Chip Drapeau; who the
coach feels is "a good ath 
lete that shows a lot of
promise." Senior Eric Chap 
man\ will be found phying
with the second unit this
year but that's only because
he's a good all-around play 
er who can give that unit
somem~ch-neededbalance
and strength.
The defensive unit will
be at a temporary loss with 
out senior J on Raymond, who
is still recovering from
a knee injury incurred dur 
ing I the football season.
But Clinton 'will find sever 
al familiar faces back there
in Dave Weiss, Ron Gale and
. Nick Fitzgerald, all experi 
enced and sound players.

Colby Squad , Look to .'NE s
BY JOHN GAFFNEY
The outcome was never
n doubt as the Tufts Mens'
SW,imming Team polished off
a helpless Colby squad last
ISaturday to end a spectacu 
lIar season. The Jumbos
finished with an 8-1 record
this year, improving on last
Iyear's 6-2 mark.
I "We shut I em out " said
ICoach Don Megerle, speaking
l
of Colby, whom the Jumbos
'
have not faced in recent
years. The Jumbos took
I first and second place in
I every event. Megerle noted
!that the win was "the big 
I gest score we I ve ever had."
I Coach' Megerle placed
I his more experiencedswim~
Imers in their off events

Ito improve their personal
Itimes ,in their strong

In other track action,
the Jumbo,s fared admirably
in last weekend's New England
Championships. Competing
against Div. I and II compe 
tition, Paul Murray placed
sixth in the 800 meters with
a time of 1. 57 . 7, and Mark
Hardie, whose scoring in
the 5000 meters was recorded
in this column yesterday,
tallied a school record with
his time in that event. Pe 
ter Kelley and Martin Schre 
belly joined with Murray
and Hardie to grab fifth
place in the two mile relay.
Their time of 7 :41.7 quali 
fied them to compete in thp
IC4A's at Princeton. It
seems the track team just
