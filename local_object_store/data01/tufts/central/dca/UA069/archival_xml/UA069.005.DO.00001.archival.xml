						<head>Introduction</head>
						<p> The encyclopedia seeks to capture 150 years of Tufts' achievements, societal contributions and outstanding alumni and faculty in concise entries. As a source of accurate factual information, the Encyclopedia can be used by anyone interested in the history of Tufts and of the people who have made it the unique institution it is. The Encyclopedia is an ongoing, constantly growing, on line resource. There are no plans for a printed version. This allows us to devote more of our time and energy to creating and maintaining the content. </p>
					</div1>
					<div1 type="preface" n="Content" id="front002">
						<head>Content</head>
						<p> Encyclopedia entries are created in four general categories: People, Events, Programs, and Places.</p>
						<p>People: Tufts graduates, professors, staff, or friends who have made a significant contribution to Tufts, to their profession or chosen field, or to society in general. In addition, people with no formal affiliation with Tufts who have made a signific ant contribution to the educational mission at Tufts may also be included. </p>
						<p>Events: Significant events in the history of the institution. This category also includes "Tufts firsts." It may include events such as the first broadcast of public television in Massachusetts, or early radio broadcasts, the development of medical pr ocedures and the like. It may also include social or athletic events including the Mayoralty, or the "Doe Dances" of the 1920s. Not all events need to be officially sanctioned university events. They may be natural disasters, or demonstrations, rallies, etc.</p>
						<p>Programs: The founding and history of a school or program, even if relatively short-lived is an essential part of the history of the university. The schools, programs, departments, etc. define the scope and reach of an institution. Histories of studen t groups and organizations are especially desirable.</p>
						<p>Places: Tufts is filled with official and unofficial places that carry special significance for the community. Memorials, monuments, plaques honoring graduates, events, etc. abound. There are also many unofficial places that carry significance as well. We would like to find and catalog as many as possible. </p>

Built in 1854 to serve as a residence for Tufts' first president, Hosea Ballou 2d, it was originally situated between Ballou Hall and Professors Row, roughly where the tennis courts on Packard Avenue lie. The house was moved in the early 1870s, probably to make way for the construction of Packard Avenue. After the death of Ballou, it continued to serve as the residence for Ballou's family. When it was relocated to Professors Row, it was used as a residence for several members of the faculty including Professor Leonard of the divinity school, Professor Lewis, and Dean Ratcliff of the School of Religion.</p>

Tweed, Professor of Rhetoric, and was occupied by him for the eight years that he remained at Tufts. Since that time it has been used for the most part as a faculty residence before it was taken in 1985 for administrative purposes.</p>
							<p>After Professor Tweed, the house was occupied by Heman A. Dearborn, Professor of Latin, until his death in 1897.Professor William K. Denison had the house for at least six years after the death of Professor Dearborn. The name of Llewellyn R. Perkins, Instructor in Mathematics, appears in connection with the house in 1904, possibly as a boarder, but no record is available of other tenants from 1904 to 1911.</p>
							<p>In 1911, the house was designated as the residence of the dean of Jackson College. Dean Caroline S. Davies lived in the house from 1911 until 1922, Dean Edith L. Bush from 1925 to 1951, Dean Katherine R. Jeffers from 1952 until 1959, and Dean Myra Herrick from 1959 until 1966.</p>

Shipman, chair of the Department of English, in 1868. Shipman resided there until 1900, when he moved to 101 Talbot Avenue and sold the Professors Row property to Zeta Psi fraternity, which had been appealing to the Board of Trustees of Tufts College for the opportunity to build or purchase a chapter house on campus for seven years.</p>
							<p>The fraternity rennovated the house, adding dormers to the roof to make the third floor rooms usable. An addition was added to the rear of the structure during the 1930s, which included a new kitchen, dinning room, and chapter room, along with additional bedrooms, study rooms, and bathrooms.</p>

Shipman, was originally occupied by a Mr. Martin, who was employed by Shipman. Upon the sale of his own house at 101 Professors Row to Zeta Psi fraternity, Shipman moved his residence to 101 Talbot. </p>
							<p>Following the death of Shipman's wife, Professor William R. Ransom and his family resided with Shipman, until they moved into 29 Sawyer Avenue in 1907.Shipman continued to reside in a small suite in the upper part of the house while Professor Melville S. Munro and his family took up residence in the greater part of the house. Munro purchased the house after Shipman died, living there for the remainder of his life. Munro's daughter continued to live at 101 Talbot for some years following her father's death in 1945 and later rented the home to family not connected to the college. Tufts purchased and renovated the house in 1953, after which Alvin R. Schmidt took up occupancy.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, 101 Talbot Avenue houses the Russian and Slavic Culture Unit providing an environment for students wishing to pursue an increased understanding of Russian and East-European culture. </p>

							<p>Dr. Thomas J. Sawyer, dean of the Theological School, occupied the house both before and after it was moved in 1876 to its current location in order to accommodate the extension of the Row to Curtis Street. Following its relocation, a third floor and pitched roof were added to the structure. Following his marriage to Sawyer's daughter, Professor George T. Knight also resided in the home. Both families are recorded as residing in the house for an extended period of time, with Knight retaining the residence for the remainder of his life.</p>
							<p>In 1917, the house was transformed into a cooperative dormitory for Jackson College students. It was sold to Delta Upsilon fraternity in 1938.The fraternity, relocating from its house on Sawyer Avenue, extensively remodeled the building, retaining only a small section of the original structure. During World War II, the building was used as barracks for a unit of Navy men. The house was returned for use to Delta Upsilon in 1948. </p>

							<head>136 Harrison Avenue, 1949</head>
							<p> In 1949, Tufts purchased an empty building at 136 Harrison Avenue in Boston to serve as the new home for the medical and dental schools. The previous building, located at 416 Huntington Avenue, was almost fifty years old, and much of its equipment was out of date. The new building, a modern, fireproof structure, had previously housed a needle trade company. </p>
							<p>The Harrison Avenue building was renovated in 1949 to house the facilities of both the School of Medicine and the School of Dental Medicine. After two years of renovation, the eight-story, 130,500 square foot building was dedicated on April 9, 1951.</p>
							<p>At a cost of $950,000, Tufts gutted the old building at 136 Harrison Ave and completely renovated the outside and inside. The new building, fifty percent larger than the Huntington Avenue complex, included offices, classrooms, a bookstore, student lounges and also the Chenery Memorial Library, and was built using a donation from alumnus William E. Chenery. The building was also conveniently located within close proximity to the New England Medical Center. For a number of years, the School of Medicine had worked jointly with the NEMC. The new location allowed students to work more closely with the NEMC, and allowed greater access to their facilities. </p>
							<p>In 1973, Tufts constructed a new building at One Kneeland Street to house the School of Dental Medicine. When the dental school vacated its offices at the Harrison Avenue building, the medical school made use of the entire facility for the next six years. In 1979, however, the newly established School of Veterinary Medicine moved into the Harrison Avenue building, remaining there until the veterinary school's current home at the Grafton campus was completed. </p>
							<p>As of 2001, 136 Harrison Avenue still houses most of the medical school's facilities, and also houses classroom facilities for first-year veterinary students. </p>

							<p> 188 Boylston Street was the first building occupied by the medical school. It was located on the site of the current Four Seasons Hotel by the Public Garden in downtown Boston.</p>
							<p>The medical school occupied two floors in the building with space for lecture halls, study rooms, and a bacteriology laboratory. In 1894 a third floor was added, with a chemistry lab and dissecting room.</p>
							<p>Successful enrollments required that the school relocate after only three years in the Boylston street building. The next home of the medical school was a renovated Baptist church located on Shawmut Avenue in Boston. </p>

							<p> The A. Warren Stearns Research Building was opened in 1962, after six years of planning, fundraising, and construction work. Located at 120 Harrison Avenue, in the center of the Tufts University School of Medicine's Boston campus, the buildingis named after A. Warren Stearns, A1906, M1910, H1943, the seventh dean of the Tufts College Medical School.</p>
							<p>The eight story, 33,000 square foot Stearns Building is home to academic departments, a number of lecture halls, laboratories for student research, the Boston School of Occupational Therapy, and modern research facilities. </p>
							<p>Originally built in 1940, the building had housed a garment factory, but was purchased by Tufts with funds acquired mainly through the bequest of Marian Cowan Garland.

							<p> The Alan Shawn Feinstein International Famine Center was established at Tufts University in 1996 to work towards improving relief efforts in times of famine, war, and emergency. </p>
							<p>The Feinstein Center opened in 1996 with help from a $2.5 million grant from Rhode Island philanthropist and hunger activist Alan Shawn Feinstein. The center works mainly in Africa to prevent famine, and also works to develop methods of resolving local conflicts and improving emergency response so that people coping with a crisis situation can survive. The center's programs focus on five main topics: livelihoods, gender and children, public nutrition, community health based initiatives, and ethics. </p>
							<p>The Feinstein Center, located at 96 Packard Avenue on the Medford campus, offers a one-year Masters of Arts in Humanitarian Assistance, and also offers two summer grant programs designed for graduate students and professors working on topics related to famine and complex emergencies. </p>
							<p>Since its inception, the center has received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundations, UNICEF, and the UNHCR, among other organizations. In early 2000, the center expanded to house the Humanitarianism and War Project, the leading U.S. publisher of articles on humanitarianism in conflict situations, formerly of Brown University. </p>

							<p> The Alex Elias Memorial Prize Scholarship, established in 1966 by the Brotherhood of Alpha Epsilon Pi and friends of Alex Elias within and outside the university, is awarded to that junior or senior who best displays those high standards in community activities and in athletic and scholastic pursuits for which Alex Elias was well known.</p>
							<p>Alexander Elias, member of the class of 1967, was born July 24, 1945. He died on October 19, 1966, from injuries sustained a week earlier in a motor scooter accident near his home in Watertown. He was gregarious, sensitive and quick-witted with a great sense of humor and a zest for life. He was accepted by the Big Brothers Association, but never had a chance to serve as an older brother.</p>
							<p>While at Watertown High School, he was an outstanding baseball player, a member of the varsity football team, and the basketball team. In fall of 1963 he was awarded the Hoyt-Thurber Memorial Trophy for outstanding student athlete, as well as the George "Koko" Gorgodian Memorial Trophy. He entered Tufts and majored in political science in preparation for a career in law. A power-hitter and strong fielder, he was starting first baseman for the varsity baseball team and was one of Tufts' most popular athletes. He was active in the Leonard Carmichael Society and House Chairman of Alpha Epsilon Pi. His fraternity brothers established the Alexander Elias Memorial Scholarship Fund as a living testimony to his memory. </p>

							<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02011"></figure></p>
							<p>In 1898 the seventy-five women of Tufts College banded together to elect officers for a new social, literary, and 'democratic' club. The All-Around Club would last for over seventy years, serving the social and intellectual needs of Tufts and Jackson women.</p>
							<p>Male students in 1898 were upset about the growing presence of women on campus. Their insecurity came through when, partly in response to the formation of the All-Around Club, they protested: "the time is not far distant when the matter of coeducation at Tufts will come to a crisis." Despite this opposition, in its first year the All-Around Club organized a faculty tea, a music night, and several receptions. Those successes opened a long, energetic history filled with operettas, an annual spring dance, music lectures, annual dinners, orientation breakfasts, sight-seeing tours, a fashion show in Packard Hall, and many more.</p>
							<p>Mundane issues came under the jurisdiction of the All-Around Club in 1903, after the Tufts College Association of Women Self-Government joined with the All-Around Club and an organization for women's athletics to form a larger club. Though this loose association soon disbanded, the All-Around Club would continue to engage in serious endeavors, publishing Jackson College directories and guides, organizing food drives, and providing a representative for the Student Council. From 1903 on, every woman enrolled at the school was included as a member of the club.</p>
							<p>The 1909 constitution of the club proclaimed as its goal "to promote unity and loyalty in the college; to further the social, intellectual, and athletic interests of the student body; and to encourage the personal responsibilities of its members."The goal remained unchanged until the club's disappearance.</p>
							<p>The All-Around Club last receives mention in an Observer article in 1969.The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the demise of many long-standing organizations as changing student attitudes brought about a new era of student activities.</p>

She owned an 800-acre farm in Dover, Massachusetts, where she raised Hereford cows, Yorkshire swine, and thoroughbred horses. After meeting a professor from the Tufts School of Veterinary Medicine at a pig auction in Pennsylvania, she took a strong interest in the university. In 1980, Peabody donated the funds necessary to establish the Amelia Peabody Pavilion at the Veterinary School. It was used for teaching and research in livestock and livestock disease, and also served as the school's first large animal hospital. Peabody died in 1984, but in 1988, her estate made a one million dollar donation to Tufts in order to establish the Peabody chair, at the time only the second endowed chair at the Veterinary School. </p>

							<p>AMRAD was first based on the Tufts hillside after Power negotiated with Tufts to use the land. He built a 304-foot radio tower and an accompanying laboratory behind <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName>.Using that tower, AMRAD became one of the first broadcast radio stations in the country. It was assigned the call letters 1XE, then later WGI, and became one of the most popular stations in the Boston area until the early 1920s.</p>
							<p> AMRAD also manufactured radio parts for both domestic and military use. During the First World War, AMRAD developed and manufactured transmitters and receivers forthe US military, and also worked on an advanced submarine detection system. AMRAD also developed a number of simplified receivers and broadcasters for civilian use. </p>
							<p>After World War I, Power built an AMRAD manufacturing plant next to the Boston-Maine railroad tracks. The plant was used to increase AMRAD's daily production capabilities, but could not save the company from financial decline. Power was not able to maintain AMRAD as a profitable company, and was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1925. </p>
							<p>In 1930, Power merged what remained of AMRAD with Motorola, and sold all the local AMRAD facilities to Tufts. Tufts turned the broadcasting laboratory into North Hall. The manufacturing plant became the Hooper Laboratory, which was later renovated and renamed Halligan Hall. </p>

Anderson (1922-1975) was an environmentalist and activist who was director of environmental affairs at the Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs, as well as serving on the faculty of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. </p>
							<p>A native of Arlington, Virginia, she served in the WAVES during World War II. Her involvement in environmental issues began at her former home in Reading, where she did a study of the Ipswich River for the League of Women Voters. The selectmen wanted to put a dump there. She organized the opposition, brought 250 people to town meeting, and persuaded the selectmen to stop the plans as well as to appoint her to the board. Mrs. Anderson was a consultant for conferences in the Northwest, in Kenya, and India, whose environmentalists point to the Tufts conference as a model. </p>
							<p>She was a member of the advisory committee to the UN Environmental Fellows Program and was also active with the World Conservation Union. She was the recipient of several awards, including a merit award from the Environmental Protection Agency and a Conservation Hero Award from the National Park Service. </p>
							<p>After her retirement from the Lincoln Filene Center, she was a senior research associate at the Global Development and Environment Institute and the Fletcher School. Her annual courses at the Lincoln Filene Center had a wide impact because they educated a generation of environmental advocates and officials who now shape policy locally and regionally. </p>
							<p>In 1979, she founded the New England Environmental Network and organized the New England Environmental Conference at Tufts, an annual event until 1996, which became one of the largest environmental gatherings in the country. By 1993, the conference attracted 1,500 people to its workshops, 150 organizations sponsored booths, and 300 environmental groups participated. She was actively involved in the protection of the northern forests of New England, New York, and the Pacific Northwest, and was influential in East Africa and India.</p>
							<p>She died in Falmouth, Maine, in November, 1997.The Nancy W. Anerson Award for Environmental Sustainability is named in her honor. </p>

							<head>Anne E. Borghesani Memorial Prize, </head>
							<p> The Anne E. Borghesani Memorial Prize is an academic scholarship award open to undergraduates in Arts and Sciences and Engineering. It is an annual incentive award that will enable the recipient(s) to undertake a project, activity, or plan of study in any field involving international issues. The prize is designed to encourage personal growth and independence, while increasing one's understanding of all peoples and encouraging a commitment to the world community. The prize is administered by the Program in International Relations.</p>
							<p>The award honors the memory of Anne E. Borghesani, J1989, an international relations major. She came to Tufts from a Lexington, Massachusetts, family with a strong Tufts tradition. She had been an active volunteer at Lexington High School and in the community. She also was a family person, an upholder of tradition, close to her parents, grandparents, and brothers. As a loyal friend and great communicator, she brought others together from different religions and cultures. Anne's years at Tufts were a time of intellectual and personal challenge, adventure, and increasing commitment to her friends, the Tufts community, and the global community. She participated in class council and dormitory government, was a resident assistant, co-led an Explorations Class on Differences in America, and interned at the Attorney General's office. Since she was interested in other cultures and travel, she majored in International Relations, traveled to Russia in 1987 with a student group, and lived with a French family when she studied in Grenoble for a semester.</p>
							<p>Throughout her short life, Anne's interactions with others consistently exhibited love, warmth, compassion, honesty, and loyalty, and emphasized the importance of personal dignity and freedom of choice. Her travels and studies increased her appreciation of her country and dedication to equal opportunity and justice. She moved to Washington, D.C. after graduation and worked as a legal assistant. At the time of her murder in March 1990, she planned to attend law school and talked of being a public defender.</p>
							<p>The Anne E. Borghesani Memorial Prize is a tribute to Anne, whose life was so senselessly and violently cut short. It is designed to encourage personal and intellectual growth in Tufts students, reminiscent of that so evident in Anne. </p>

Anthony, ca. 1900</head></figure> Gardner Chace Anthony (1856-1937), M1890, H1889, H1905, served Tufts College as the first dean of the Engineering School. Anthony House, at 14 Professors Row on the Medford Campus, was Professor Anthony's residence during his lifetime and is named in his honor.</p>
							<p>Anthony was born in Providence, Rhode Island, an area first settled by his ancestors, on April 24, 1856.He attended the English and Classical School of Providence, although failed to graduate due to poor health. In 1874, Anthony began work in the drafting room of the Providence Steam Engine company in preparation for his entrance to Brown University the following year. In 1877, he left Brown to pursue special studies in engineering at Tufts. Anthony then continued work in drafting rooms while he married Susie A. Pearson in 1879. They had one son. </p>
							<p>He obtained his first teaching position at Rhode Island School of Design in 1885, where he was appointed Director of the Mechanical Department. Two years later, he founded the Rhode Island Technical Drawing School, and in 1889 assumed the principalship of the Pawtucket Evening Drawing School. He obtained a master's degree from Tufts in 1890. </p>
							<p>Anthony maintained his positions in the Rhode Island schools until he returned to Tufts in 1893 as dean of the Bromfield-Pearson School and professor of Technical Drawing for the college. When the engineering courses at Tufts were organized into a separate school in 1898, Anthony became the program's first dean, holding the position until his retirement in 1927.During the thirty-four years he was affiliated with Tufts, Anthony worked to establish, organize, and promote the College of Engineering, watching its enrollment more than quadruple during his tenure. In 1921, following the death of his first wife, he married Ella Taylor. At his retirement, Anthony was made dean emeritus of the Engineering School.</p>
							<p>Recognized as an authority on mechanical drawing and machine design, Anthony was active in several academic and engineering societies, including the American Society for Mechanical Engineers and the American Association of Arts and Sciences. He served as president of the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education in 1913, having held the position of vice-president two years earlier. He published at least five books covering drawing, descriptive geometry and machine design, including the "Technical Drawing Series," and is also attributed with introducing the term "Graphics" to describe the various phases of drawing.</p>
							<p>Anthony died on November 28, 1937, in New Rochelle, New York. </p>

							<p>Beginning in 1928, Dean Frank C. Wren and his family occupied the house for ten years, until 1938, when it was transformed into a dormitory for Jackson College students. It was refurbished and decorated under the guidance of Mrs. Pearl Carmichael, wife of President Leonard Carmichael and was occupied by sixteen freshman and a resident house mistress. </p>
							<p>In 1955, Charles E. Stearns, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and professor of Geology resided in Anthony House for a brief period of time before returning to his own home in Billerica. It returned to being a women's dormitory until 1969, when it was restructured into a creative arts freshman house. By the 1980s, the house had developed into the Crafts House.</p>

													<p>Harry Arlanson (1909-1998), E1931, served as Director of Physical Education at Tufts from 1954 to 1974, although he is perhaps best remembered for his prowess as a football coach, compiling a 217-59-15 lifetime record. </p>
													<p>Arlanson, born May 4, 1909, in Lynn, Massachusetts, received his early education in Lynn schools, where he captained his high school baseball team. He entered Tufts in 1927 as an engineer, and began actively participating in Tufts' athletics. He captained the baseball team his junior and senior year, and was also captain of the football team his senior year. After receiving his degree from Tufts in 1931, Arlanson moved on to Boston University, where he received a master's in education in 1935.</p>
													<p>Between 1935 and 1954, Arlanson worked as director of physical education and head coach of the baseball and football teams at Weymouth high school. His coaching soon earned him the nickname, "The Magician." His football accomplishments included eight undefeated teams, six class A championships, and the Gator Bowl championship in 1950. He turned Weymouth's football team from a class C team into the most feared squad in the state. In 1954, Arlanson began work as the director of physical education at Tufts. He coached the football team for twelve years, turning them into a strong and respected squad during the fifties. </p>
													<p>Arlanson received the Tufts University Distinguished Service Key and was named New England Coach of the Year in 1959. After stepping down from coaching the football team, Arlanson devoted much of his time to administrative duties, including roles on several ECAC and NCAA committees. After his retirement in 1974, Arlanson served as an official of the Eastern College Athletics Conference. He was elected to the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Hall of Fame in 1974, complementing his election to the Massachusetts Coaches Association Hall of Fame ten years earlier. In 1990, the Legion football field in Weymouth was renamed Arlanson Gridiron in his honor.</p>

At the time of its construction, the architectural design was considered extraordinary, and the lab won the Educational Citation Award in the tenth annual Design Awards Program of Progressive Architecture Magazine. </p>
							<p>Built to increase opportunities for chemistry research at Tufts, each floor of the four-story building contains a large lab and conference room, an equipment room, and private offices and labs for researchers. The top floor was built to house the Walter F. Rockwell Chemistry Library. Each floor is connected to Pearson Hall by a glassed in walkway. The laboratory is named after Dr. Arthur Michael, a professor and research chemist at Tufts from 1881 to 1912, who helped give the university an international reputation in chemical research.</p>
							<p>By 1980, Michael Laboratory had become outdated and was facing design problems as well. The old exhaust system in the lab, once considered state of the art, had begun to recirculate toxic fumes into the air system on the top floor. In the summer of 1981, the lab underwent extensive renovations. The old exhaust system was replaced, and the labs were reworked to allow research space for seven professors. </p>
							<p>Aside from a small chemical spill on April 25, 1989, that forced the evacuation of the building, Michael Lab has remained quiet since 1981. It continues to serve as Tufts' main chemistry research facility. </p>

							<p>Audrey Louise Hale joined Tufts as a secretary in 1947 after graduating from Fisher College. Her first job was in the Office of Veterans Affairs helping the veterans who returned to college on the G.I. Bill after World War II. In 1952, she transferred to the office of the first provost, John P. Tilton, and has worked with every provost since. She was appointed Assistant Provost by Sol Gittleman.</p>
							<p>Audrey Hale and her husband have been active in various host family programs at Tufts for over twenty-five years, particularly those of the International Office and, more recently, the Fletcher Host Family Program.</p>
							<p>Audrey Hale received the Alumni Association's highest award, the Distinguished Service Award, in 1968, and an honorary Bachelor of Arts from Tufts upon her retirement in 1995. She served on many committees and enjoyed taking courses and being involved with Faculty Club programs. As a result of trips to Europe, the Far East, Central, and South America, her interest in the international programs at Tufts grew. The students she and her husband have come to know through the International Office programs have enriched their lives immensely and she hopes the yearly prize will reward many wonderful students in the future. </p>

							<head>Baby Parties, 1915-1954</head>
							<p> Baby parties were an annual tradition at Jackson College from the early part of the twentieth century through the late fifties. </p>
							<p>Jackson freshmen, as part of the many hazing rituals common on college campuses, were required to forgo makeup, put their hair in braids, and dress as babies for a day. In the evening, the freshmen "babies" gathered for a baby party run by the sophomore class. Early in the century, the parties included elaborate, and sometimes cruel, hazing rituals. In the early 1920s, for example, sophomores dressed in Ku Klux Klan - like outfits, and paddled, drenched, and generally frightened the freshman, who were led through the gymnasium hallways blindfolded. After the initial hazing, both classes gathered together for an evening of skits and dancing. The more cruel aspects of the parties, however, had disappeared by the mid-1920s. Instead, sophomores dressed as nurses for the babies, seniors dressed as old women, and juniors appeared dressed as uninvited guests or poor relations. These parties featured stunts performed by the freshman class, followed by short skits from both sophomores and freshmen alike. Prizes were awarded for the cutest "baby" and her runner-up in the 1950s.</p>
							<p>Baby parties gradually disappeared as large-scale hazing went out of fashion as the 1950s came to a close, but the tradition of making Jackson freshmen dress as babies continued into the early 1960s. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02635"><head>Professor of Dramatics Marston Balch, ca. 1980</head></figure>Marston Stevens Balch (1901-1987), known as "Doc" to thousands of Tufts people, helped establish the university's Department of Drama and Speech and Tufts' reputation in the dramatic arts. During his thirty-five years on the Hill, Balch inspired generations ofstudents and faculty, teaching them that theater without intellect and compassion is inevitably theater without artistry and humanity.</p>
							<p>A descendent of hardy "New England stock" who settled in Salem in 1636,Balch was born in Detroit, Michigan, on November 21, 1901.He matriculated at Kalamazoo College, where his father was head of the Department of History, in 1919.After graduating in 1923 with highest honors and a degree in English, Balch moved to the East to attend Harvard, earning a Masters of Arts in 1925, and a Ph. D. in 1931, both in English with a concentration in dramatic literature and in theater history. During his studies, Balch traveled extensively through England and France doing research on Elizabethan drama and English influences on French drama.</p>
							<p>He began teaching as an instructor of English and theatrical director at Williams College in 1925.He also held similar positions at the Browne and Nichols School, The New England Conservatory of Music, Harvard, and Phillips Exeter Academy.</p>
							<p>In 1934, Balch joined the Tufts faculty as assistant professor of English. The following year he also became thedirector of Drama, the executive director of the Tufts College Theater, and advisor to Tufts' Pen, Paint, and Pretzels. From 1935 to 1966, Balch directed and produced almost 100 plays, many of which he translated from French and were presented in the United States for the first time. </p>
							<p>In 1940, Balch persuaded Tufts to take a leadership role in the arts by establishing the first Department of Drama and Speech in a New England. He served as the department's chairman, professor of Drama, and Fletcher Professor of Oratory for twenty-six years. Balch, however, did leave Tufts temporarily during this time to serve as chief of the French Press and Radio Analysis Section of the US Information Service and as chief of Cultural Relations Section under the Department of State during World War II.</p>
							<p>Upon his return to the college in 1947, Balch directed his first full-scale production in the arena theatre configuration, which he had experimented with while he was in France. He was the first University Presenter at Tufts and from 1957 to 1969 served as chairman of the Arts and Sciences Faculty Committee on Academic Awards. He also served during his career at Tufts on the Committee on Administration Policies and the Programs Committee of the Graduate School. Balch retired in 1971, becoming professor emeritus.</p>
							<p>Balch was married to Germaine Cornier, a native of France, who taught French at Tufts for twenty years, beginning in 1943.Their daughter, Gabrielle, J1950, is a Jackson College graduate. After Cornier's death in 1969, he married Roberta Blanchard in 1976.</p>
							<p>As a result of his service to France during World War II, Balch was honored by the French Republic three times: in April 1946, he received a medal and honorary membership in the Association Des Professeurs Des Langues Vivantes; in 1947, the Medaille de la Reconnaissance Francais was bestowed upon him; and in May 1953, he was again distinguished by being a recipient of the Croix de Chavalier de la Legion d'Honneur.</p>
							<p>Aside from translating an enormous body of work from French into English, Balch published at least forty scholarly articles, sixty articles for the Tufts University Theater publication, Prologue, and six books. He was a member of various organizations and societies related to the arts, including the National Council of Arts in America and the National Theatre Conference, of which he was Executive Secretary from 1961-1968.In 1966, he was the recipient of the Margo Jones University Award in recognition of his encouragement of aspiring playwrights. He also received an honorary doctorate by Kalamazoo College, his alma mater.</p>
							<p>The Marston S. Balch Arena Theatre was named in Balch's honor in 1983, following the generous gift of one of his former students, Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce. </p>

The cornerstone was laid in 1853 and construction was completed the following year. Designed by Boston architect Gridley James Fox Bryant (1816-1899), Ballou Hall was initially referred to as simply College Building or College Hall. It housed classrooms, the library, laboratories, a museum, administrative and faculty offices, student living quarters, and a chapel, now the Coolidge Room.</p>
							<p>As Tufts grew, Ballou Hall no longer had to serve as the home of all college activities. One by one, the library, chapel, academic departments, and laboratories were moved from Ballou into new facilities. One hundred years after its completion, plans were made for extensive renovations to the interior of Ballou to better adapt the building to its new role as administrative heart of the university. The last classes were held there in the spring of 1955, and renovations were completed over the course of the next several years. The Coolidge Room, dedicated in 1957, was named for Arthur W. Coolidge, A1903, and his son Robert T. Coolidge, A1936.As the large chapel for Tufts College, it was the site of the first faculty meeting on October 9, 1854, and the second commencement for the college.</p>

Barnum. Barnum donated the building to house his collection of animal specimens and featured the stuffed hide of Jumbo the elephant. Thus the building was initially known as the Barnum Museum of Natural History. The architect of the original structure was Phillip Rinn.</p>
							<p>Announcement of the building of the Barnum Museum, made at the same time as that of the Goddard Gymnasium, was greeted with joy by students. Following the announcement, a huge bonfire was built on the hill while students cheered and rang the bell continuously.</p>
							<p>Two wings were later added to the building. In 1894, a west wing was added with facilities for classrooms, laboratories, and a library, funded by a bequest from Barnum's estate. In 1935, an east wing was constructed to provide additional lab space and offices for increasing enrollments. This wing was named for Professor Lambert. The Dana Laboratory was added to the west wing of the building in 1963 to bring the laboratory facilities to the level required by the increasing needs of the Department of Biology.</p>
							<p>On April 14, 1975, a fire that began in faulty wiring in a refrigeration unit in the building gutted the Barnum Museum. The collection housed in the building was completely lost, including numerous animal specimens, Barnum's desk and bust, and the stuffed hide of Jumbo. Damage to the east and west wings of the building was not as great, but faculty research materials were lost. The Dana Laboratory was unharmed by the blaze. The building was rebuilt within the original stone facade the following summer, but only to the height of the Dana Laboratory building. The architects of the post-fire renovations were Kubitz and Pepi.</p>

Barnum (1810-91), showman and circus entrepreneur, served on the board of Trustees of Tufts College and as a benefactor of the institution in its early years.</p>
							<p>P. T. Barnum was born in Bethel, Connecticut, on July 5, 1810.He held a series of diverse jobs as a youth, including selling theater tickets. In 1835 Barnum exhibited Joice Heth, an old black woman he claimed to be the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington, at Niblo's Gardens in New York City. He then became head of a traveling company of performers, acrobats, freaks, and wild animals. </p>
							<p>In 1840 Barnum bought and re-opened the American Museum in New York City. Exhibits included the Feegee [sic] mermaid, the bearded lady, and the "Egress," along with fossils and natural history specimens. Barnum discovered and exhibited the dwarf Tom Thumb and made several tours to England and Europe (1844, 1858).He modeled his Connecticut mansion Iranistan (destroyed by fire in 1857), in part, on the Brighton Pavilion. In 1850 Barnum brought Jenny Lind to America for a concert tour. In the 1870's Barnum organized the "Greatest Show on Earth," which traveled by train through the United States and Canada. In 1881 he joined his business rivals to form the Barnum and Bailey Circus. Barnum died in Bridgeport, Connecticut on April 7, 1891.</p>
							<p>After being elected to the Trustees in 1851, Barnum resigned in 1857, because his busy schedule of tours precluded his attendance at board meetings. In fact, the only record that exists of Barnum actually visiting the campus was in 1886 for the commencement ceremony. On the occasion of that visit the Tufts Glee Club greeted him with "The Barnum Song" composed by then-student Leo Rich Lewis, who was later to become professor of music and composer of numerous Tufts songs.</p>
							<p>Barnum continued to take an interest in the college, secretly donating over $50,000 to Tufts in the years 1882-84 to build the Barnum Museum of Natural History. He also left over $30,000 in his will to build two subsequent wings. Barnum had the bodies of circus animals preserved and mounted by Ward's Natural Science Establishment (taxidermists) for exhibit in the museum.</p>
							<p>In 1881, Barnum bought Jumbo, then the largest known African elephant, for $10,000 from the Royal Zoological Society in London. After great protest in England, he brought the animal to America. In 1885, Jumbo was killed by a train in Ontario, Canada. The elephant, stuffed by Carl Akeley and William Critchley, was taken on more circus tours.</p>
							<p>In 1889, the stuffed remains of Jumbo were donated to the Barnum Museum at Tufts, with the idea that the publicity might be useful to the College. In 1889 Barnum made his last tour to England and compiled the scrapbook of his trip which is now in the collection. In April, 1975, a fire in Barnum Hall destroyed Jumbo and much other Barnumiana, including Barnum's desk, his bust, many circus posters, and some letters. </p>

							<head>Bartol House, 1894</head>
							<p> Bartol House, located at 37 Sawyer Avenue on the Medford Campus, was built in 1894 for Heth Aleph Res, the Divinity School fraternity. Since that time it has served a number of purposes including a residence for women, an infirmary, a faculty residence, and undergraduate housing. It was named for Mrs. John W. Bartol in 1955, when it became a dormitory for students in the Eliot Pearson School.</p>
							<p>Heth Aleph Res resided at the house until 1899.From 1900 to 1903 it was a residence for women students who boarded themselves. From that point it served as a residence for faculty: Charles C. Stroud of the Department of Physical Education lived there until 1905, when Harry G. Chase of the Department of Physics moved in. He remained until 1912, when it returned to student use with the Commons Club, a local fraternity, moving in. In 1916 it was taken as a dormitory for Jackson students as well as serving as the women's infirmary. In this period it was known as Gamma House and a bridge connecting the house with Hooper Infirmary directly behind it allowed the women's and men's infirmaries to more easily share staff and resources.</p>
							<p>In 1955 the house was given for the use of Eliot Pearson students and assumed its current name of Bartol House, in honor of Mrs. John W. Bartol.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, Bartol House serves as a special interest residence for undergraduates. Its theme is Arts House, for students interested in fine arts. </p>

							<head>Baseball, 1863</head>
							<p> The first official baseball game at Tufts College was played on September 5, 1863, when a team of sophomores defeated the freshman team 9-6. Since then, baseball has flourished at Tufts, and the baseball program has consistently been one of the school's strongest athletic programs.</p>
							<p>Although baseball has been played at Tufts since the opening of the college, it was not until 1863 that a game was recorded as official. That year, a group of freshman challenged the sophomore class to a game, and the next year, an official baseball program was organized. In 1864, two teams appeared on the Tufts campus, the All Nine and the Ballou Club. The teams competed against each other in a two-semester series, with the All Nine eventually coming out on top. In 1868, the Tufts College All Nine began competing informally against other local schools. The next year, Tufts recorded its first recognized intercollegiate game against Brown University. In 1870, after receiving brand new uniforms, the team rallied to a 12-4-1 season, but would struggle for the next few years. By 1883, the Tufts team was beginning to gripe about the lack of local media coverage they were receiving. They had been winning consistently, and even beat one opponent so badly that an opposing player left the field during the game with the only game ball, forcing the early cancellation of the match. </p>
							<p>By 1890, baseball was beginning to cause controversy between the faculty, the administration, and students. The Tufts faculty was refusing to allow players to cut class for games, and would not give special treatment to student athletes. A year later, the baseball team charged the faculty with interference after they vetoed a team vote for captain. The player elected captain was no longer a student at the college, and the faculty felt it was unethical for the individual to play on the Tufts team. Although reluctant at first, the administration eventually came out in support of the faculty. In 1895, the Tufts squad beat Harvard for the first time, finally giving Tufts a victory in their long-standing rivalry with the neighboring university. The next year, the first inter-fraternity game took place, with the Delta Tau Delta fraternity defeating the Theta Delta Chi team. This game also marked the introduction of cheerleaders at Tufts baseball games. </p>
							<p>Between 1910 and 1920, Tufts baseball had some of its most successful seasons since the inception of the program. In 1914, Tufts hired former major league catcher John T. Slattery as coach of the baseball team. George Stalling, the coach of the Boston Braves at the time, said of Slattery, "Jack knows more about baseball than any man in the country with the possible exception of Connie Mack." From 1914 to 1916, Slattery's team was 51-13, and the 1916 team produced six All Americans. In fact, three members of the 1916 team went on to play in the major leagues. That season, Harold Leland led all college hitters with a .437 average, Heinie Stafford stole twenty four bases and batted .406 in twenty games, and Horace Ford proved himself to be the premier shortstop in college ball. Stafford went on to play for the New York Giants, and Ford, who graduated in 1918, went on to play major league ball for four different teams in a fifteen year major league career. After Slattery left Tufts in 1916, Ford served as coach and as the starting shortstop while still an undergraduate. Also during the 1916 season, catcher "Red" Carroll caught his last game for Tufts on a Saturday, and was behind the plate the following Tuesday for the Philadelphia Athletics.</p>
							<p>In 1920, Tufts hired another former major leaguer, Ken Nash, to coach the team. Nash coached from 1920 to 1940, serving as a district judge in Massachusetts at the same time. During the twenties, the team was quite successful. In 1927, they posted a 16-4 record and defeated Dartmouth on Class Day and Harvard on Alumni Day. In 1941, however, the baseball program was suspended due to the war, and didn't resume until after the end of the conflict. The post-war team would be the first to play on the new field across from Cousens Gym. </p>
							<p>For the next five years, the program continued with moderate success, and in 1948 pitcher "Bud" Niles set a Tufts record with twenty-eight wins and three losses in his three varsity seasons. In 1950, the Tufts squad went to the NCAA World Series for the first time ever. They defeated Bradley College, but were beaten by Texas and Washington State. In 1958, Tufts captured its first Greater Boston League title with a 10-4-1 record, and in 1961, the team produced another two major leaguers, Norm Heinze and Joel Kelfer.</p>
							<p>In 1964, Herb Eriksen was named coach of the Tufts squad, and served until he died of a heart attack in 1974, the morning after Tufts broke a nine game losing streak. He was replaced by assistant Rick Giachetti, who brought a novel coaching tactic to the Tufts squad. Giachetti made practices more rigorous, concentrating on different skills each day, but still the team only managed to post a 6-13 record that season. In 1976, Leo Fanning replaced Giachetti as coach, and in 1978 he led the team to a victory in the early spring Florida Tournament. Tufts lost only one game of the tournament; a short game called early due to rain. </p>
							<p>In 1983 John Casey, A1980, was hired to coach the team. A former manager in the Boston Park League, Casey brought the team some of its greatest success in the history of the program, leading them to the ECAC tournament in 1987, 1988, 1989, and 1990. It was in 1986, however, that Tufts saw some of its most exciting baseball action. On April 6, 1986, pitcher Jeff Bloom pitched a no-hitter against the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Seven days later, he repeated the feat against a strong Boston University squad. Finally, on April 19, with major league scouts in attendance, Bloom pitched his third consecutive no-hitter, retiring the first twenty batters before walking what would have been the game's final out. The feat gained national attention, and even earned Bloom coverage on the NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw. </p>
							<p>In 1988, despite a sub-par 14-12 record, the Jumbos managed to be named the last seed in the ECAC tournament, and shocked everyone by winning their first two games and advancing to the finals, where they were defeated by Brandeis University. The next year, however, the team rebounded from a 10-9 start to capture the ECAC championship, defeating Wesleyan, Salem State, and Plymouth State in the tournament. </p>
							<p>Although in the early nineties, the team had a few disappointing seasons, they were able to rebound, winning the ECAC again in 1994, and earning an NCAA tournament berth in 1995. These seasons, along with the 1996 and 1997 season, were highlighted by the pitching of Jeff Taglienti, A1997, who was drafted by the Boston Red Sox.</p>
							<p>In the 1996, 1997, and 1998 seasons, the team advanced to the ECAC playoffs, but slumped in 1999 and did not advance to post-season play. The 2000 team, however, set the 136-year-old program's record for wins, posting twenty-six for the season. </p>

							<p> The Bates Student Research Group was established as the Bates Society at the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine in 1935 in honor of the late professor George A. Bates, D1889, M1903, G1904. Bates was a Tufts alumnus who later taught histology and biology at both the medical and dental schools from 1896 until his death in 1925. He was well known for his research and publications in the field of histology. </p>
							<p>The Bates Student Research Group acts as the local chapter of the Student Research Group of the American Association for Dental Research. </p>
							<p>The Bates Student Research Group defines its objectives as: 1) Increasing information about research opportunities at Tufts, especially for first year students. 2) Increasing communication between students and Tufts faculty regarding research opportunities. 3) Discussing research currently being conducted at Tufts and other dental schools.</p>
							<p>Bates also gave his name to Bates-Andrews Day, an annual opportunity for Tufts Dental School students to present research in dentistry and special interest fields. Bates-Andrews Day was established in the 1930s, and is held each year in February or March. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00513"><head>The Beelzebubs, 1965</head></figure>Tufts' all-male acapella singing group, the Beelzebubs, was founded in 1962.It began when a group of students prepared an acapella rendition of "Winter Wonderland" for the annual Christmas Sing. They were a hit, and the group expanded, becoming the Beelzebubs. </p>
							<p>The name was the suggestion of John Todd, A1964, who had the devil's right hand man on his mind from an English course on Milton he was taking at the time. The formal name of the ensemble, Jumbo's Disciples: The Beelzebubs, is rarely used, and they are more commonly known simply as the Bubs. The Bubs' first formal concert appearance was at a sorority dance in spring 1963, where they sported madras jackets and crew cuts and were paid $35.</p>
							<p>A founding member of the group was Timothy L. Vaill, A1964, who coordinated the group's first performance at the Christmas Sing in 1962. Vaill's father was a leader of the Yale Wiffenpoofs, an acapella group, and the knowledge Vaill gained from his father's experience was a motivating factor in establishing the Tufts group. At the time Tufts had no small-scale singing groups; the university chorus was a large ensemble and though there were a few informal folk groups, there was nothing of like the Bubs. In the 1950s there was briefly an acapella group called the Tuftones, but they had long since disappeared. Since then the Bubs have flourished and are one of the longest-lasting student groups on campus, and the only group other than the Leonard Carmichael Society to survive the turbulent years of the 1960s. The group averages twelve members at any given time and holds auditions two or three times per year.</p>
							<p>The Bubs perform often on campus and travel to other area schools for joint performances with other campus groups. They have also traveled around the country and the world, singing at schools and events representing Tufts. In recent years the group made a cameo appearance on the Late Night with David Letterman television show on CBS and sang during pregame activities at Major League Baseball's All-Star Game at Fenway Park, both in 1999. </p>
							<p>The Bubs have an active alunmi association, the Beelzebubs Alumni Association (BAA) which brings together alumni of the organization several times a year for reunions and singing.</p>
							<p>The Bubs' musical style has undergone dramatic expansion from its early roots in traditional barbershop style music. By the mid 1980s the group had added arrangements of popular music to its repertoire along with the traditional Tufts tunes. Over the years more choreography has been added to the routines and the group's performances embrace a variety of styles. Members of the group do all of the arrangements and each year's Bubs work up an all-new raft of songs. Over the years the Bubs have released twenty-two recordings, most recently a CD titled "CODE RED" in 2003.</p>
							<p>In addition to its extensive schedule of performances, the Bubs administer the Beelzebubs Foundation, which provides grants to support music education in Massachusetts public schools. Since its founding in 1991, the foundation has provided funds to support the purchase of equipment, instruments, and sheet music in communities in the Boston area.</p>

							<p>Until 1948, when the Taberna opened, the bookstore was run out of the basement of Eaton Library. Those cramped quarters were deemed unsuitable and the decision was made to construct a proper bookstore that would also provide a snack bar and space for the accounting office, which had outgrown its quarters in Ballou. The new structure, designed by Arland A. Dirlam, was dubbed the Taberna by then-president Leonard Carmichael.</p>

							<p>The 11,000 square-foot building will house an expanded Wildlife Clinic, including a filtered pool for aquatic animals, and indoor ward for carnivores, small and large animal runs, flight cages, enlarged surgical and diagnostic facilities and a conference room for seminars and public gatherings. The center brings together under one roof Tufts' signature programs in Wildlife Medicine and International Veterinary Medicine as well as the Center for Conservation Medicine. Housing the three disciplines together fosters collaboration of global health issues such as environmental degradation, infectious disease, antibiotic resistance and loss of biodiversity.</p>
							<p>The building was designed by Spagnolo / Gisness &amp; Associates, Inc., with two separate wings linked with a central core area. The central core encompasses the reception and waiting areas and a clerestory display that stretches to the ceiling throughout the space. Overlooking the fields is a forty-person lecture hall with access to an outdoor patio for animal observation. </p>

							<p>The building was originally named in honor of Austin Barclay Fletcher, A1876, and one of the uiversity's greatest benefactors. He was a long-time member of the Board of Trustees, beginning in 1909, and from 1913 until his death in 1923, was president of the board.</p>
							<p>When Fletcher Hall was opened, each student paid $150 per year as room rent. Original equipment furnished each student by the college constisted of a desk, desk chair, a bed, a mattress, and a chiffonier. The building, in the Georgian architectural style, is built of red waterstruck brick with limestone trimmings and a slate roof.

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02230"><head>Dr. Edwin C. Bolles, ca. 1880</head></figure>Edwin Courtlandt Bolles (1836-1920), Dickson Professor of English and American History, was the first chaplain of Tufts College. Bolles also served as a lecturer in the Divinity School and a trustee of the college. He assembled a vast collection of materials pertaining to the history of London, which are held in the University Archives. He is credited with devising a reference system that is reminiscent of modern "hypertext."</p>
							<p>Bolles was born in Hartford, Connecticut, on September 19, 1836.He attended Trinity College, graduating in 1855.As a result of his strong religious convictions, he aligned himself with the Univeralist faith and was ordained as one of its minister at the age of nineteen. He continued his studies, receiving his M.A. and LL.D. also from Trinity, in 1859 and 1905, respectively. He obtained a doctorate in 1860 from St. Lawrence University, and a doctorate of sacred theology from Tufts in 1880.At that time, he began a nine year term as a trustee of the college. He served as pastor of congregations in New England, New York, and Louisiana, leaving the South following the outbreak of the Civil War.</p>
							<p>His involvement with Tufts increased in 1889, when he began lecturing in the Divinity School. An entertaining lecturer, he presented a series of talks on London when he first joined the faculty. He also lectured on microscopy at the Society for Natural History in Boston and associated himself with the Peabody Academy of Science in Salem. While also preaching in Salem, Bolles befriended Walter Scott Dickson, who founded the Dickson Professorship in English and American History at Tufts for Bolles in 1900. Bolles was made the first chaplain of the university in 1905.</p>
							<p>Bolles established a private collection of materials, including rare books, pamphlets, and maps, pertaining to the history of London. He amassed much of his collectionwhile living in London during the 1870s. His interest in London may have partially stemmed from his unbroken ancestral lineage dating back to William the Conqueror. He took on the task of illustrating Walter Thornbury's Old and New London with more than 8,000 pictures he had collected. </p>
							<p>Instead of cutting the six volumes to insert the additional illustrations, Bolles devised a plan for underlining the passages to be illustrated and making marginal notes that referred to numbered illustrations in the vast files he maintained, organized by volume, chapter and page. Most of this work, considered to be a precursor to modern "hypertext," was carried out with help from his assistants after Bolles had lost his sight. He completed the work one year before he died. The collection was purchased by the trustees in 1921 for $1,400 and was given to the college's library as a memorial to the late professor.</p>
							<p>Bolles died at his home on College Avenue on January 11, 1920. He had twice been married, and was survived by two daughters, Margaret Bolles and Eleanor K. Hoit. His son, Courtlandt Kimball Bolles, a Lieutenant in the US Navy, predeceased him in Germany in 1902.</p>
							<p>Bolles' residence on College Avenue, now used by the university for administrative offices, is named in his honor. </p>

							<head>Bonfires, 1875</head>
							<p> For many years, bonfires were the chosen means by which Tufts students on the Medford campus celebrated sports victories and other good news, despite being forbidden by proclamation of the college administration. The first recorded incidence of a bonfire was from 1875, when students seized a decrepit picket fence along the southern boundary of the Reservoir to fuel the flames. The occasion that prompted the fire is not known. In later years the Somerville Fire Department was quick to douse the fires when they appeared, and bonfires petered out in the years following World War I.</p>
							<p>Packard Avenue, between <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName> and the Reservoir, was a favorite spot for bonfires. Ready access to the water of the Rez assured that the flames would not get out of control, but the trees in the vicinity suffered. Bonfires were also kindled behind <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName>, on the "Old Campus" (Fletcher Field), and on the south embankment of the Rez.</p>
							<p>Fuel for the fires came from fences, boardwalks, and any other combustible material that could be located. When the local sources were exhausted, foragers went further afield, occasionally resulting in bills to the college for damages. After a time a pile of old boxes and waste lumber was kept on the slope behind <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName> for the tacit use of bonfire-builders.</p>
							<p>Billboards erected alongside the college depot were another favorite source of fuel, much to the advertisers' anger. However, they made such a spectacular blaze that they were popular with the students, who reportedly thought the billboards an eyesore. Billboard fires were kindled in 1897 and 1898, both on the occasion of football victories over Tufts' traditional rival, Bowdoin College in Maine.</p>
							<p>The use of bonfires diminished and all but disappeared after World War I. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Boston School of Occupational Therapy, 1945" id="B00028">
							<head>Boston School of Occupational Therapy, 1945</head>
							<p> The Boston School of Occupational Therapy (BSOT) is part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences on the Medford campus. The school was founded in 1918 and was first affiliated with Tufts in 1945. It offers master's degrees and several certificate programs in aspects of occupational therapy, and is accredited by the American Council for Occupational Therapy Education.</p>
							<p>The Boston School of Occupational Therapy, affiliated with Tufts since 1945, was founded in 1918 at the request of the surgeon general of the United States, to assist in the rehabilitation needs of hospitalized service personnel during World War I. The school, one of the first of its kind in the country,was incorporated in 1921, with a three year course of study leading to a diploma in occupational therapy. The school admitted women only, until 1967, when the first male student was granted a degree from the school. In 1945, the Boston School of Occupational Therapy became affiliated with Tufts University through the College of Special Studies. The school merged with Tufts in 1960 to form the Tufts University-Boston School of Occupational Therapy within the Faculty of Artsand Sciences. When the undergraduate component of the curriculum was phased out in 1986, it became part of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. </p>
							<p>The school was originally located on Harcourt Street in Boston. As the school strengthened its ties to Tufts, it moved in 1959-60 to the School of Medicine's Boston campus, where it occupied two floors of the NEMC Stearns Building. In January 1982, it moved to the Conwell Building in Somerville, a former elementary school, adjacent to the Tufts campus. BSOT is currently located at 26 Winthrop Street on the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>The school originally offered a professional undergraduate course of study. Upon joining with Tufts through the Division of University Extension, the school offered a five-year program in which students could earn the diploma in occupational therapy and a B.S. in education with four years of academic study and one year of clinical experience. </p>
							<p>In 1960, the school merged with Tufts University, becoming the Department of Occupational Therapy in the College of Special Studies, while continuing to use the BSOT name. In 1961 the degree of B.S. in occupational therapy was offered as an alternative to the B.S. in education. By 1967 the faculty of BSOT was included in the university's policy on academic freedom and tenure, and the non-degree certificate program was eliminated, both signifying the closer relationship between the school and the university.</p>
							<p>Similar to other schools administered by the extension division, BSOT students lived a separate existence from other Tufts undergraduates and were enrolled in separate sections of liberal arts courses and lived in their own dormitories. As BSOT became academically and administratively more closely integrated with Tufts, this situation provoked the BSOT Alumni Association for the "second class" status of the school and its students to be addressed. The merger of BSOT with Tufts was a step toward remedying this situation, and at this time upper class students were moved into shared housing with Jackson College and the Eliot Pearson School. However, BSOT students continued to be required to shuttle between the Boston and Medford campuses with no real "home" on either.</p>
							<p>In the 1960s and 1970s enrollments grew significantly from eighty students in 1962-63 to over 200 in 1975, when the school was granted full accreditationby the American Occupational Therapy Association.</p>
							<p>In 1971 the degree requirements for the undergraduate degree were changed to match those for Liberal Arts and Jackson, and in 1972 a combined degree program with a B.S. in occupational therapy and an M.S. in education was authorized.1977 saw the establishment of an M.S. in occupational therapy degree.</p>
							<p>In 1982, BSOT moved all of its operations to the Medford campus and at the same time was separated from the College of Special Studies to form its own constituent school in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
							<p>In the fall of 1986, a decisionwas made to discontinue the undergraduate curriculum in occupational therapy, with no additional undergraduates being admitted to the program.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, BSOT continues to offer education in occupational therapy at the masters level as well as several certificate programs in continuing education for registered occupational therapists.</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02579"><head>Bouve-Boston School of Physical Education, 1957</head></figure>The Bouve-Boston School of Physical Education was affiliated with Tufts in 1942, and continued as an undergraduate professional program in the College of Special Studies until it was affiliated with Northeastern University in 1964.</p>
							<p>The Bouve-Boston School of Physical Education was founded in 1913 with Marjorie Bouve as co-director. The school was for women with a secondary school education who wanted to teach or supervise physical education classes. From 1931 until 1942, the school was affiliated with Simmons College. A physical therapy curriculum added in the early 1920s was accredited by the national physical therapy organization in 1928.</p>
							<p>In 1942 Bouve-Boston was affiliated with Tufts through the Division of University Extension and subsequently through the College of Special Studies. At the time, Tufts, feeling the pinch of losing enrollments to the war effort, sought programs to enroll women in order to generate income in that difficult time. Students in the school could work toward a B.S. in education with additional coursework in psychology and education. At first only qualified students, comprising those in the top one-third of their class, were permitted this option, though by 1948 most of the Bouve-Boston students were enrolled in the degree program. In 1961 a B.S. in physical therapy was added.</p>
							<p>The school was originally located in quarters on Huntington Avenue in Boston. In the years immediately following its affiliation with Tufts, Bouve students had to commute between Boston and Medford to complete their coursework. However, in 1950 the school constructed a building with a gymnasium and classrooms on the Medford campus. In 1956 it added a dormitory for its students, named Ruth Page Sweet Hall, also in Medford. When the school disaffiliated in 1964 both of these buildings were transferred to Tufts. The gym became Lane Hall and the dormitory was renamed Hill Hall.</p>
							<p>Throughout its affiliation with Tufts, the Bouve-Boston School struggled to find a place for itself in the Tufts community. Despite the administration's desire to place greater emphasis on the liberal arts curriculum in the program, students were segregated from the general Jackson population in separate course sections until after 1956. Bouve students were excluded from Jackson athletic teams on the grounds that their avocation would render them too competitive and exclude Jackson students from athletic opportunities. While Bouve students were permitted to participate in other student organizations in theory, it was left to the individual organizations to decide if Bouve students would be admitted.</p>
							<p>When Nils Wessell became president of Tufts he voiced a general concern about the affiliated professional schools, including Bouve, and the lack of emphasis on liberal arts in their curricula. Following the university's self-study in 1958 he strongly advocated that Bouve restructure its course of study to a five-year plan, with four years devoted to liberal arts and the fifth providing the professional training necessary for licensure in physical education. In 1962, with the support of the trustees, Wessell presented Bouve and the other affiliated schools with the option of either adapting their curriculum to Tufts requirements and integrating fully with the university or disaffiliating from the university entirely. Bouve chose the latter option and in July of 1964 officially ceased its affiliation with Tufts and moved to Northeastern University in Boston. Students currently enrolled in the program were given the option of receiving either Tufts or Northeastern degrees, and the last student to receive a Tufts degree did so in June, 1968. </p>

At Tufts, Bowen held the only remunerative position the college had to offer a student during his time as an undergraduate, ringing the old College Bell on top of Ballou Hall. He dreamed of one day providing Tufts with a new, larger bell. However, the Class of 1898 presented the college with such a bell at their tenth reunion, leaving Bowen to bestow alternative gifts on his alma mater. Bowen was also manager of the Tufts football team. After being one of fourteen men to graduate from the School of Engineering in 1876, Bowen briefly served as principal of the high school in Adams, Massachusetts, before returning to work in his father's hay and grain business.</p>
							<p> A faithful attendant of Tufts' commencement exercises and alumni days, Bowen presented the college with a pair of lion statues to stand guard outside of Barnum Museum in 1923, and with Bowen Gate in 1925. He also provided the funds for the memorial tablets of Hosea Ballou and Austin B. Fletcher, one of his classmates, at the north entrance of Ballou Hall, while sponsoring the construction of the columned porch at that entrance. During alumni festivities, Bowen, a descendant of eleven Revolutionary War soldiers, would don the uniform of the color guard of the Massachusetts State Society, Sons of the American Revolution, and parade around the campus with a replica of the 1776 Bennington Battle flag. </p>
							<p>In 1924, Bowen was made a life trustee of the college. The class of 1926 invited him to be an honorary member of their class, honoring him for his unwavering loyalty on the fiftieth anniversary of his graduation. He had been the organizer and past president of the Berkshire Tufts Club, in addition to his duties as a trustee. The same year, he gave his greatest gift to the school, a set of chimes to be played from the tower of Goddard Chapel.</p>
							<p>Bowen died April 19, 1952, at his home in Cheshire, following a long illness. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living Tufts alumnus, and the only living member of the class of 1876. </p>

							<head>Brunswick, Ruth Jane Mack, 1897-1946</head>
							<p> Ruth Jane Mack Brunswick (1897-1946), M1922, was a psychoanalyst and student of Sigmund Freud. Her work significantly expanded and explored Freud's theories.</p>
							<p>Brunswick was born on February 17, 1897 in Chicago, Illinois. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1918, but attended the Tufts School of Medicine after being rejected from Harvard's medical school because she was a woman. Following graduation she travelled to Vienna to study with Freud, becoming a member of the small circle of students instructed by him.</p>
							<p>By 1925 she was practicing psychoanalysis herself and had become an instructor at the Psychoanalytic Institue in Vienna. She became an editor of the Psychoanalytic Quarterly in 1932 and published one of her most notable early papers on her continuing treatment of the Wolf Man, one of Freud's most famous cases. She was widely respected in the field as a brilliant, thorough, and effective clinician.</p>
							<p>She married in 1928 American composer Mark Brunswick. The couple left Nazi-occupied Vienna in 1938 to settle in New York City, where she joined the New York Psychoanalytic Society and taught courses on the subject, while maintaining a private practice. Though Brunswick had comparatively few professional publications, they are considered to be of classic quality and to contribute significantly to the full development of Freudian theory, particularly in the areas of childhood trauma and parental attachment.</p>
							<p>Brunswick died in New York City on January 24, 1946. </p>

							<p>Burden was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on February 25, 1890. He attended public schools in Lynn and the University of Maine, graduating in 1912. In 1913, he joined the Tufts faculty as an instructor in Civil Engineering, beginning an almost sixty-year long career at the institution, and in 1917, introduced a five-year combined degree program between the schools of engineering and liberal arts. While working at Tufts, Burden also obtained masters degree in municipal and sanitary engineering from Harvard University, in 1928. </p>
							<p>Moving through the academic ranks, Burden became a full professor in 1930, and was appointed dean of the School of Engineering in 1936.During this time, he was a pioneer in warning of the coming problems of water pollution and urban transportation. He also began interviewing students for admission following his appointment, which he continued to do until his retirement. In 1953, Tufts conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering on Burden, followed four years later by a student honor of having the yearbook dedicated to him. The inscription included the words "His aim has always been to avoid letting his students graduate understanding their science but not themselves."Following his retirement in 1957, he was made Dean Emeritus.</p>
							<p>Following the death of his wife, Lunetta, in 1961, Burden lived alone at Start House, 17 Latin Way, until 1968, when he moved to his final home at 162 Curtis Street.

Choosing to attend her father's alma mater, as did her brother and sister, Bush graduated from Tufts in 1903. As an undergraduate, Bush had been active in Chi Omega sorority and Phi Beta Kappa. </p>
							<p>From 1906 to 1918, Bush was appointed head of the mathematics department of Chelsea High School where she taught her younger brother, famed scientist Vannevar Bush, trigonometry. She also served as principal of Provincetown High School before returning to Tufts as an instructor of mathematics in 1920. Returning to campus, she also served as housemistress of Start House, one of the Jackson dormitories.</p>
							<p>Bush was appointed assistant professor of mathematics in 1922, becoming the first woman to teach courses in the School of Engineering. In 1925, Bush was made dean of Jackson College and also a full professor of mathematics. She moved, with her mother, into 72 Professors Row, which had been home to the previous dean of Jackson College. Tufts conferred an honorary doctor of letters on Bush in 1942. She had also been the recipient of the Alumni Association's Distinguished Service Award the previous year.</p>
							<p>In 1952, after thirty-two years of service to her alma mater, Bush retired and was made dean emerita. Tufts named a new dormitory, Bush Hall, in her honor in 1959. Bush died following a long illness in Waltham, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1977. </p>

The dormitory contains fifty-one double rooms and three single person rooms.</p>
							<p>In 1991, no undergraduates resided in Bush as a result of the lowered demand for campus housing due to the combination of South Hall's completion and low rental fees for off campus housing. This surplus of housing allowed fifty-six graduate students to be housed in Bush for the academic year.</p>

The original first floor lounge was torn down to create a loading dock for the dinning hall, with a new lounge being constructed in conjunction with study rooms, a TV room, and kitchen facilities.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, Bush Hall continues to be used a co-educational dormitory for undergraduate students. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.04128"><head>Vannevar Bush, n.d.</head></figure>Vannevar Bush (1890-1974), E1913, G1913, life member of the Board of Trustees, noted benefactor, and recipient of the Ballou Medal, was nationally recognized as an outstanding scholar, engineer, and scientist who developed an early version of the computer and oversaw scientific research in the United States during World War II.</p>
							<p>Bush received both his bachelor and master of arts degrees from Tufts in 1913, and received his Doctor of Engineering degree through a joint program between Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1916.Following his graduation, Bush continued his association with Tufts as an instructor in mathematics, assistant professor in Electrical Engineering, and professor of Premedical Physics until 1917. He worked with several other recent Tufts' alumni in 1915 to develop on campus the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD), which remained affiliated with Tufts until 1931, when it merged with Magnavox.</p>
							<p>In 1919, Bush returned to MIT as an associate professor of Electrical Power Transmission, gaining full professorship in 19, and then, Dean of Engineering in 1932.The same year he was appointed vice-president of the Institute. While a member of the faculty, Bush joined with two associates, including his former Tufts roommate, Laurence Marshall, to found the American Appliance Company, which later became Raytheon Manufacturing Company and continued to evolve into the Metals and Controls Corporation, which manufactured nuclear fuel. </p>
							<p>He was also an early figure in the development of computer technology, recognizing the need for machine able to perform mechanical tasks too arduous for mathematicians. In 1930, he developed a differential analyzer, the predecessor of the analog computer.</p>
							<p>Bush left MIT in 1938 to become president of the Carnegie Institution, a scientific research organization in Washington, D. C. He retired from the organization in 1955, returning to MIT as Chairman of the Corporation. He also served on the Board of Directors of several large corporations including as Chairman of the Board of Merck and Company.</p>
							<p>During World War II, Bush servedthe nation in a number of scientific and policy capacities, including as chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. He was a central figure in the development of nuclear fission and the subsequent development of the atomic bomb. His report, "Science, the Endless Frontier," which he submitted to the President of the United States in 1945, had a far reaching impact on peacetime research and technology throughout both the country and the world. Bush died on June 28, 1974.</p>
							<p>Bush was awarded his first of more than two dozen honorary degrees in 1932 from Tufts and began his service to the college as a trustee in 1933. In 1941, he was recipient of the Ballou Medal, the highest award Tufts bestows upon an alumnus. He also received the Distinguished Service Award of the Tufts Alumni Council in 1947. Bush aided in the building program for the College of Engineering in the 1950s and in the Tufts University Program, the 1960s capital fund drive. </p>
							<p>Bush's father, Reverend Richard Perry Bush (R1879, H1905) was a Universalist clergyman and lecturer at Tufts School of Religion at the time of his son's birth in 1890 and continued as a member of the faculty when Bush was a freshman at the college. Both of Bush's sisters were also alumnae of the college, with Edith Linwood Bush (W1903, H1942) serving as dean of Jackson College for twenty-seven years and also as the first female professor of Mathematics in the Engineering School. </p>

							<p>The Cabot Intercultural Center was constructed in 1981 to expand the facilities of the Fletcher School and to serve as a home to the undergraduate Program in International Relations. It was named after John and Elizabeth Cabot, who donated one million dollars to the project. John Cabot was a former ambassador to Brazil, Colombia, and Poland, among other countries. He served as Ambassador in Residence and taught classes at the Fletcher School during the 1960s. </p>
							<p>The seven-story building, designed by Architectural Resources Cambridge, Inc., cost a total of $12.5 million to complete. The majority of the funds came from a number of government grants approved in 1977. The United States Congress granted Tufts $6.9 million to build the center in recognition of Fletcher's contribution to the U.S. Foreign Service. The Fletcher School raised the remainder of the money through budget manipulation and donations, the largest being the Cabot grant.</p>
							<p>The construction of the Cabot Center was slowed in the spring of 1981 by two separate strikes. A nine-week bricklayer strike beginning on April 30, and a six-week carpenter strike beginning June 15 delayed the opening of the building, planned for late summer, to mid September, 1981. When it was finally opened, the Cabot Center included the 350-seat ASEAN auditorium, a large gallery, an audio-visual lab, a library, and offices for Fletcher and International Relations personnel. The seventh floor of the building contained a large conference center and balcony, connected by the Salle Francaise, a lounge furnished by the French government. The audio-visual lab was relocated to the Olin Center in 1990, opening up more space for the Fletcher School in Cabot.</p>
							<p>Since its opening, the auditorium in Cabot has been host to a number of distinguished speakers. Philip Habib, President Reagan's special envoy to the Middle East, spoke at the building's dedication on September 18,1981. Since then, the auditorium has hosted such speakers as Michael Dukakis, former Secretary of Energy and Tufts alumnus Bill Richardson, NOW president Patricia Ireland, and noted physicist Stephen Hawking.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, the Cabot Intercultural Center still serves as a home to the Fletcher School and the International Relations program. Large undergraduate courses also often meet in Cabot auditorium. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS093:MS093.001.DO.04986"><head>The cannon, June 1966</head></figure>The cannon, a fixture of the Medford campus, is located between Ballou Hall and Goddard Chapel. It is a replica of an original twenty-four pound cannon taken from the deck of the USS Constitution "Old Ironsides."Since 1977, it has been used by student groups and individual students who paint messages on the cannon under the cover of night.</p>
							<p>The cannon was a gift from the city of Medford and the Medford Historical Society, which had received the cannon a number of years before but did not have room to properly display it. It was given to the city by the National Park Service as a thank-you for funds raised by community schoolchildren to restore Old Ironsides.</p>
							<p>In 1956, Tufts accepted the gift of the cannon from Medford and mounted it on a foundation between Ballou Hall and Goddard Chapel. It remained there until the mid 1960s, when it was removed for repairs and not replaced due to anti-military feeling on campus. It remained in storage until 1977, when a group of alumni led a movement to have the cannon returned to its original spot.</p>
							<p>During the Fall semester of 1977, the cannon was painted as a protest, perhaps of the visit and conferral of an honorary degree on Imelda Marcos of the Philippines, in October 1977.It was quickly repainted by a student who objected to the defacing of the historic monument. Thus, the tradition of painting the cannon began and became an almost nightly activity. In 1985 and again in 1996, the cannon was sandblasted to remove the many layers of paint applied over the years.</p>
							<p>For many years it was believed that the cannon was one of the original cannons from Old Ironsides. However, when Buildings and Grounds workers were removing the cannon from the front doors of Ballou Hall on the morning of Commencement in 1987, where student pranksters had placed it the night before, the cannon fell and a piece broke off, revealing that it was a replica.</p>
							<p>Painting the cannon is a competitive activity. Students must guard their handiwork or run the risk of having their message painted over by a rival group. Over the years the cannon has sported political messages, rallying cries for athletic teams, and birthday greetings. </p>

When Capen became president in 1875, the Trustees felt that it would be desirable to have the incoming president live on the campus rather than commute, as had his predecessor, Alonzo Ames Miner, who lived in Boston but came to Medford almost every day to conduct two classes as well as presidential business.</p>
							<p>The house was completed the following year at a cost of $21,692.89.The ground floor was especially designed for receptions and social assemblies. One of its first uses was to house a meeting of the New England Association of College Presidents, which met on the Tufts campus for the first time. A portion of the foundation of a small stable built on the western side of the house remains as a retaining wall.</p>
							<p>President Capen resided in the house he built until his death in 1905.The next two presidents, Hamilton and Hooper, lived there as well. President Cousens elected to remain at his residence in Chestnut Hill during his presidency, at which time increasing enrollments in Jackson College led the house to be converted into a dormitory for women. In 1970 the house became a coeducational undergraduate residence, and in 1977 it was made the home of the African American Center.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, the house continues to be used as the African American Center as well as a residence for students interested in African American culture. </p>

							<p> Samuel Paul Capen (1878-1956), A1898, son of Tufts president Elmer H. Capen and recipient of the Ballou Medal in 1948, was a life trustee of Tufts.</p>
							<p>The son of Tufts president Reverend Elmer H. Capen, Samuel Paul Capen was born in Capen House on Professors Row. He graduated from Tufts in 1898 with both a bachelor and master of arts degree. Capen had been the president of his class, a member of Theta Delta Chi fraternity, vice-president of the Tufts Publishing Association and assistant football manager as an undergraduate. He received an additional master of arts degree two years later from Harvard, and in 1902, obtained his doctor of philosophy degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He also spent a years studying abroad at the University of Leipzig. Following his graduation from Harvard, Capen began teaching at Clark College, where he remained for twelve years, rising to the rank of full professor in Romance Languages and lecturer in educational administration. In 1898, he married Grace Duncan Wright, the daughter of Clark's president. They had one daughter, Mary.</p>
							<p>From 1914 to 1919, Capen worked as specialist in higher education for the United Stated Bureau of Education.

							<p> Antonio de Jesus Cardozo (1903-1984), F1934, was the first student to enroll at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. </p>
							<p>Born June 14, 1903, in the Cape Verde Islands, Cardozo spent his youth in Portugal before immigrating to the United States at age seventeen. After working as a cowhand on his uncle's California ranch, Cardozo decided to move east and expand his career possibilities. After finishing high school while working nights at a factory in Connecticut, Cardozo enrolled in Suffolk University, where he earned a degree in law in 1929. From there, Cardozo would reverse usual education procedure and enroll as a freshman at Harvard University. Cardozo graduated from Harvard in 1933, and after hearing about the Fletcher School during his senior year, enrolled as the first student in its first class. </p>
							<p>Cardozo's association with Fletcher did not end after his 1934 graduation. In fact, Cardozo attended every commencement at Fletcher from 1934-1984, becoming known around campus as "Mr. Fletcher." Cardozo started a tradition by inviting members of the entering class at Fletcher to his Arlington home every year, and was the driving force behind the establishment of the Fletcher Alumni Association.</p>
							<p>In 1961, Cardozo, who founded a law firm in Boston after his graduation, became the first Fletcher graduate to receive the Distinguished Service Award from Tufts. In 1968, he would become the first representative of Fletcher elected to the Tufts Board of Trustees. </p>
							<p>Besides running his successful law practice, Cardozo was active in community affairs, working closely with the Cambridge Community Center and local Portuguese communities. </p>

							<p> Tufts University purchased Carpenter House from the Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity in 1968. When Tufts bought the house, it was renamed to honor Russell L. Carpenter, A1924, a former member of the biology department and longtime curator of the Tufts University Barnum Collection. It is located at 8 Winthrop Street on the Medford Campus.</p>
							<p>Phi Epsilon Pi acquired the house in 1940, remodeling the sixteen-room house slightly to accommodate between sixteen and eighteen fraternity brothers. The fraternity remained in the residence until the fraternity was closed in 1968 due to a lack of student interest and a high occurrence of drug use in the fraternity residence. Although in 1969, fraternity members tried to rejuvenate interest in Phi Epsilon Pi and reacquire the house, their efforts failed, and the university converted the house into the first home of the Afro-American Culture Center.</p>
							<p>The Afro-American Culture Center remained in Carpenter House until 1977. During its stay, residents often had to deal with harassment, especially from members of the local community. In one incident, local teens threw rocks at the house, breaking three windows, and yelled racial slurs at the residents. </p>
							<p>In 1977, the Afro-American Culture House relocated to the Capen House on Professors Row. Carpenter House was again converted to serve as a dormitory, and housed mainly upperclassmen. On March 3, 1979, a major fire at the Carpenter House severely damaged the building. Although no one was injured in the blaze, much of the house was demolished. </p>
							<p>At a cost of $155,000, Tufts rebuilt Carpenter House, changing the original shape to make it more suited to a dormitory, and students were able to return to the building by September 1979. Since then, Carpenter House has served solely as a dormitory. From 1990 through 1994, Carpenter House was unstaffed, making it a popular residence for upperclassmen. After the house was repeatedly damaged during parties, the university decided to begin staffing Carpenter House again. Carpenter House also briefly served as a home for transfer students in 1993, after a large class of transfers filled the allotted housing facilities.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, Carpenter House continues to serve as an undergraduate dormitory. </p>

							<head>Carpenter, Russell LeGrand "Bud", 1901-1991</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02859"><head>Professor Russell L. Carpenter sitting at P.T. Barnum's desk, ca. 1955</head></figure>Russell LeGrand "Bud" Carpenter (1901-1991), A1924, H1977, was professor of zoology, an active alumnus, and curator of the P.T. Barnum Collection during the more than thirty years he spent on the Hill. </p>
							<p>Born in Meriden, Connecticut, in 1901, Carpenter entered Tufts in 1920 intending to study English and become a journalist, after spending a year as a reporter following high school. He received twenty-five dollars in student aid from the college and one hundred dollars from the Universalist Church to help finance his education. After attending the lectures of Professors Herbert Neal and Fred Lambert in biology, Carpenter changed his major to biology. During his undergraduate years, he wrote a column for the Tufts Weekly, sang in the Glee Club, and also played the banjo in a small dance orchestra. </p>
							<p>Following graduation from Tufts in 1924, he entered the Graduate School of Harvard University, receiving his doctorate in zoology in 1928.That same year, he married Elsie Stuart Clark, with whom he had two children, and started teaching in the new anatomy department at the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. </p>
							<p>Carpenter returned to Tufts in 1938 as professor of zoology succeeding his former professor. Addressed as "Doc" by his students, he was recognized on campus for his teaching in both the classroom and laboratory and his many years as the college's pre-medical advisor. The 1968 yearbook was dedicated in his honor on the occasion of his retirement. </p>
							<p>His scholarly and research interests were the histology of the eye with specific focus on the biological effects of microwave radiation on the eye. This led to the establishment of the Microwave Radiobiology Research Laboratory, of which he served as director and principal investigator. He published more than a dozen papers on the subject. Tufts awarded him the honorary degree doctor of science in 1977.</p>
							<p>He also was a lecturer in ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School for thirty-five years and acted as a consultant on ophthalmic biology for the Retina Foundation in Boston. For thirty years he served on the faculty of the summer Lancaster Course in Opthalmology for specializing physicians. Carpenter received many scientific honors, including election as a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
							<p>Beyond his teaching, Carpenter's involvement with Tufts as an alumnus was substantial. He was the first editor of the Tufts Alumni Review, the president of the New York Tufts Club, and, beginning in 1943, a member of the Tufts Alumni Council. He received the Tufts Alumni Distinguished Service Award in 1942 and also served on the committee in charge of redesigning the Tufts Seal.</p>
							<p>Carpenter undertook the responsibility of establishing the Tufts University Barnum Collection, which included letters and personal mementos of P.T. Barnum. Acting as the collection curator, Carpenter spread the story of Tufts and Jumbo through his notable, witty lectures, using whatever honoraria he receivedto acquire additional items for the collection and to maintain the Barnum Room where Jumbo was located. In March 1968, for the first time in his thirty years as a professor, Carpenterpresented a lecture on the history of Jumbo and how he "happened to matriculate" to his Biology 2 classes at Tufts. President Hallowell was extended an invitation to attend the morning course.</p>
							<p>Carpenter retired from Tufts in 1969.The following year he was invited to establishand direct a program of microwave bio-effects research for the Bureau of Radiological Health of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Carpenter died in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on July 28, 1991.</p>
							<p>The room in Barnum Hall where Carpenter presented his lectures carried his name from his retirement until the building burned in 1975. The top floor of Barnum's newest west wing was given and identified by a plaque in his name by the donor when it was constructed. His former students established the Russell L. Carpenter Fund for Teaching and Research in Biology following his death; it supports summer research by undergraduate interns. Carpenter House, a student residence located at 8 Winthrop Street, was named in his honor. In 2001, his former national research colleagues honored his work and memory by publishing all his research papers in a single volume. </p>

							<p> Chandler House, located at 125 Powder House Boulevard, is named for Miss Martha H. Chandler, long-time administrator and teacher in the Eliot-Pearson School. It was originally a private residence, and was acquired by Tufts to serve as a dormitory for Eliot-Pearson students, for which purpose it was used until 1966. For a number of years it was unofficially called Perkins House, after an assistant to the Dean of Students in charge of residential arrangements.</p>
							<p>In 1963 it was renamed "Boulevard House" by the Trustees and used as a college dormitory. In 1966 at the suggestion of Myra Herrick, Dean of Jackson College, when the house became a Jackson dormitory, it was renamed Chandler House. President Wessell facetiously suggested that, inasmuch as it was to be used as a Jackson dorm, it be called "The Powder House."</p>
							<p>As of 2005, Chandler House is used as the Spanish Language Unit, providing a residence for students interested in the Spanish language and the culture of Spain and Latin America. </p>

							<head>Chandler, Martha, 1894-1984</head>
							<p> Martha Chandler (1894-1984), an early childhood educator, played a prominent role in establishing the Eliot-Pearson School on Tufts' Medford campus.</p>
							<p>Born December 5, 1894, Chandler graduated from Smith College in 1917 and received a Master of Education degree from Harvard. She also obtained a certificate from the Ruggles Street Nursery School and Training Center, beginning her career in early childhood education. She taught for several years in Cambridge, and then organized and directed a nursery school at Wheaton College. From 1940 to 1944, she served as director of the Ruggles Street Nursery School in Boston. When the school transformed into the Nursery Training School of Boston, Chandler held the position of Supervisor of Student Teaching.</p>
							<p>When the school moved to Tufts' campus, she remained as a member of the faculty. From 1957 to 1959, Chandler was acting director of the program, which was by then known as the Eliot-Pearson School. Her specialization was in literature for young children and she was instrumental in assembling a valuable library for the Eliot-Pearson Department. She retired in 1967 after forty years of work in early childhood education. In January 1984, Chandler died in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
							<p>Chandler House on the Medford campus was named in her honor. </p>

							<p>The first bell, an "A" Victory bell, was given by the Class of 1898 on the occasion of their tenth reunion in 1908.This bell was used to announce football victories and other Tufts events, in addition to ringing the hour. In 1926, an additional nine bells were given by Eugene A. Bowen, A1876, who worked his way through Tufts as the campus bell-ringer. These bells are known as the Bowen Chimes, in his honor. The final fifteen bells were given in 1964 in honor of John P. Tilton, provost and senior vice-president, who died in 1959. </p>
							<p>Previous to the acquisition of the "A" bell in 1908, a lesser bell in the chapel tower was used to summon students to class and chapel services. Before the chapel was built, the campus bell was located on the roof of Ballou Hall. The duties were performed by a student employed as bell-ringer, a sought-after position paying $40 annually, and one of few on-campus employment opportunities at the time.</p>

							<figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS007:MS007.010.DO.00241"><head>John Ciardi, 1940</head></figure>
							<p>John Anthony Ciardi (1916-86), A1938, H1960, was a widely recognized critic, etymologist, poet, and translator whose works affected the literary experiences of millions of American children and adults.</p>
							<p>Born in Boston's North End, Ciardi spent his youth in Medford, Massachusetts, in a home on South Street, overlooking the Mystic River. He began his college career in the prelaw program at Bates College, Lewiston, Maine, but transferred during his sophomore year. As an undergraduate at Tufts, he began to write under the tutelage of the poet John Holmes. He particpated in few campus activities, mainly writing for Tuftonian, a literary magazine, and acting for Pen, Paint, and Pretzels. With Holmes's urging, Ciardi submitted a collection of his work for consideration of the Hopwood Prize, which had been won the previous year by playwright Arthur Miller. Ciardi won, gaining national attention before he completed college.</p>
							<p>After graduating from Tufts in 1938, he attended the University of Michigan, receiving his M.A. in 1939, and served from 1942-45 in the U.S. Army Air Corps as a B-29 gunner in the South Pacific during World War II.He later resumed his career as a writer and teacher of English at Kansas City University, Rutgers, and Harvard.</p>
							<p>Choosing to focus his attention solely on his writing, Ciardi gave up teaching in 1961. He has been called "a poet for the 'middlebrow' reader," authoring more than forty books, primarily consisting of poetry for adults and children, including "The Birds of Pompeii" and "How Does a Poem Mean."From 1956-77, Ciardi helped shape the literary tastes of Americans as a critic and poetry editor for Saturday Review. He also penned what is regarded by many critics to be the finest English translation of Dante's Divine Comedy, especially Inferno, which sold more than 3 million copies. Ciardi focused not on following Dante's rhyme scheme, but attempted instead to relay the feeling propelling the original textby using tense modern verse idiom. He also collaborated on "Limericks, Too Gross" and "A Grossery of Limericks" with Isaac Asimov during the late 1970s and early 1980s. </p>
							<p>Ciardi was also a highly respected etymologist, studying the history of words. Aside from publishing "A Browser's Dictionary," he also spoke weekly on National Public Radio about words and word groupings. At the time of his death, he was working on an etymology book for children. He died at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey, on March 30, 1986. With his wife, Judith, Ciardi had three children, Myra, John, A1976, and Benn. </p>

							<p>The Class of 1947 Victor Prather Scholarship Fund was established by the Class of 1947 on the occasion of their twenty-fifth reunion to memorialize a respected friend and classmate. Victor A. Prather, Jr., A1947, M1952, was a flight surgeon assigned to aviation and space medicine research when he lost his life at the end of a highaltitude flight in a strato-lab balloon designed for space equipment testing. He was a scholar devoted to the advancement of man's knowledge, and he was a leader uncompromising in his ideals. Financial assistance is awarded to students who meet the university's criteria for need and who demonstrate in their studies the same enthusiasm for learning that Victor Prather did in his lifetime.</p>

							<head>Coat of Arms, 1939-66</head>
							<p> In 1939 a coat of arms was adopted for Tufts College. Prior to that time, the college seal was used on both official and unofficial documents associated with the college. Leonard Carmichael advocated the adoption of a coat of arms for use to represent Tufts on unofficial documents, arguing that use of the seal should correctly be used only to authenticate diplomas and other documents issued by the Board of Trustees. To that end, a coat of arms was developed and authorized for use by any member of the Tufts community, including graduates.</p>
							<p>The arms were designed by Maurice Biscoe of Andrews, Jones, Biscoe, and Witmore, an architectural firm that designed several buildings on the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>The shield, with a blue background, was divided into four quarters showing the sun, two books, and the descending dove with the motto on a ribbon below and leaves on either side. Brown was not used on the arms, despite being one of the college colors, because brown was not an appropriate color in heraldry. The exact shape of the shield and the use of leaves and ribbon motto could be altered.</p>
							<p>As confusion arose in later years about when the seal or the coat of arms should be used, and the design of the seal was revised. The use of the coat of arms was discontinued in the mid 1960s. </p>

							<head>Cohen, Edward E., 1891-1959</head>
							<p> Edward E. Cohen (1891-1959), H1952, was a Boston-based industrialist and philanthropist. A major donor to the Tufts University School of Medicine, Cohen's donations also facilitated the construction of the Cohen Arts Center. </p>
							<p>Cohen, born in Boston in 1891, received his schooling at the Franklin Institute, Boston College, and the University of Southern California. In 1915, Cohen and his brother organized the Way Leather Company. Originally a small storefront operation, Way Leather Company grew to become one of the largest leather manufacturers and wholesalers in the Boston area. During World War II, almost all of Way Leather's business was with the military, providing lend-lease opportunities and general supplies.</p>
							<p>After the Way Leather Company became a profitable enterprise, Cohen began a career as a philanthropist. He founded the Congress of Clubs of Boston, and served as president of the Building Corporation for the Hillel House at Boston University, eventually donating much of the money used to build a Hillel facility on the campus. Cohen also served as director of the Brandeis University Association and was a lifetime member of the NAACP. In 1943, Cohen donated $125,000 to the Tufts University School of Medicine. The gift was eventually used to build a new auditorium on the Boston campus. Cohen continued his philanthropy to Tufts in 1955, donating $300,000 of the million dollars necessary to construct the Cohen Arts Center, which was named in his honor. </p>
							<p>To honor his service to Tufts and the community, Tufts awarded Cohen an Honorary Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree at commencement in 1952, and Cohen was made an honorary life member of the Class of 1916. </p>
							<p>Cohen died of natural causes at his home Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 4, 1959. </p>

							<head>College Acres, 1918-1950</head>
							<p> "College Acres" was a parcel of land acquired by Tufts University at the end of World War One. It was originally used to provide extra playing fields for university sports teams on the Medford campus. </p>
							<p>Prior to the first World War, the area across from Cousens Gym, bordering College Avenue, was largely undeveloped. It was made up of an old brickyard, some abandoned clay pits, and the remains of a city dump. Tufts purchased the land at the close of World War I for the express purpose of expanding the school's athletic facilities. It was converted to playing fields for baseball, soccer, and lacrosse, practice fields for football and track, and drill and parade grounds for military units. Students came to call the area "College Acres," a name which would stick into the 1940's. </p>
							<p>By 1950, some of the fields had been razed to make room for the addition of a parking lot directly across from Cousens Gym. Around the same time, one of the playing fields was renamed Alumni Field, and to this day is the location for many junior varsity sporting events. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, "College Acres" consists of Alumni Field, the Stearns parking lot, a baseball diamond, and various other fields used for practice and competition by Tufts squads. </p>

							<p>In the fall of 1916, members of the Jackson chapter assisted the Boston branch of the National College Equal Suffrage League at their annual conference in the Copley Plaza Hotel. Later that year, the Jackson chapter brought pro and anti-suffrage speakers to Tufts in order to educate students about both sides of the movement. </p>
							<p>After 1916, the Jackson chapter's prominence diminished, but the organization did manage to educate the campus about the importance of women's suffrage. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="College of Engineering, 1898" id="C00027">
							<head>College of Engineering, 1898</head>
							<p> The College of Engineering was formally established in 1898, though engineering courses and degrees had been offered as part of the Tufts College curriculum since 1865.The College of Engineering is an undergraduate professional school made up of departments of chemical engineering, civil and environmental engineering, electrical engineering and computer science, and mechanical engineering.</p>
							<p>The first engineering courses were introduced into the Tufts curriculum in the academic year 1865-66 with the advent of a three-year degree program in civil engineering. Students in the program received a degree of civil engineer (C.E.)The course of study was similar to that in the regular course, but with French as the designated language and a greater emphasis on mathematics, including trigonometry, surveying, descriptive and analytical geometry, differential and integral calculus, and mechanics. Students completed courses in organic and inorganic chemistry, botany, mineralogy, geology, and physics, as well as rhetoric, intellectual and moral philosophy, logic, and political economy. Drawing was required throughout the program. The focus of the program was on practical application, with the result that students were frequently out and about doing field projects on campus and in the surrounding area.</p>
							<p>In the early years of the school, equipment and funds were in short supply with the result that student projects were often designed to accomplish the dual purpose of educating students as well as creating much-needed equipment for the school. Before funds were raised to purchase a steam engine, students were directed to design their own as a drafting exercise. In 1894, the electrical engineering department constructed, for less than $700, an alternating current dynamo that would have cost $2,000 to purchase.</p>
							<p>In 1890 the Department of Electrical Engineering was created, and in 1892-93 the course of study was extended to four years. With the advent of the four year program the degrees granted were bachelor of civil or electrical engineering. In rapid succession the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the Department of Chemical Engineering were established in 1894-5 and 1898-9, respectively.</p>
							<p>Originally the engineering departments, along with most of the other academic activities, were housed in Ballou Hall. As the college and the engineering programs grew, it was clear that engineering needed its own facilities. A first step in this direction was the establishment of the Bromfield Pearson School in 1893.The school was a preparatory school for students desiring to study engineering at Tufts, and in addition to training prospective students, the building constructed for the purpose provided much needed laboratory and classroom space. Additional facilities were added over the years with the construction of Robinson Hall in 1894, Howe Laboratory in 1901, Bray Laboratory in 1947, and Anderson Hall in 1960.</p>
							<p>Gardner C. Anthony was the first dean of the College of Engineering, appointed in 1898.</p>
							<p>Like Tufts' other professional schools, the College of Engineering struggled for many years with enrollment demands greater than its capacity, lack of endowment, and strained resources.</p>
							<p>The College of Engineering added graduate study to its curriculum beginning in the 1961-62 academic year, with masters degrees available in all four departments. Ph. D. programs were added in mechanical engineering in 1963, electrical engineering in 1964, engineering design in 1981, and civil engineering in 1985. </p>

							<p> The <orgName n="College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College">College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College</orgName> officially merged in 1980, when the position of Dean of Jackson College was renamed the Dean of Liberal Arts and Jackson College.</p>
							<p>Although classes at Tufts University had not been segregated by sex since 1913, Jackson College and the College of Liberal Arts had remained separate institutions. Jackson had retained its own social life regulations, including some rather archaic curfew and guest rules. </p>
							<p>Dean Antonia Chayes, appointed as Dean of Jackson College in 1968, became the first dean to work publicly to join the two colleges. She suggested that the two colleges be joined, as she felt the separation was merely an "administrative fiction."Chayes recommended that the two colleges should have a single academic dean, and an associate dean to aid in student affairs. Chayes also worked to rescind the rules curtailing social life Jackson. The university, however, largely ignored Chayes' work. She resigned in 1970, citing the lack of a university response to her recommendations. </p>
							<p>Finally, in 1980, without even a formal announcement to the faculty, the Dean of Jackson College became the Dean of Liberal Arts and Jackson. By the mid-eighties, it was clear that although female students continued to receive Jackson degrees, the two colleges were fully joined.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, Jackson College remains a college in name only."J" is used to distinguish female students in Arts and Sciences and while the diploma granted to women graduates mentions Jackson College, it is issued by Tufts University. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="College of Special Studies, 1939" id="C00029">
							<head>College of Special Studies, 1939</head>							
							<p> The College of Special Studies began in 1939. It serves as the administrative home of programs for continuing education and certain special degree and certificate programs at Tufts. It began as the Division of University Extension, to provide professional education for students unable to attend a regular schedule of classes. Classes were offered evenings and weekends.</p>
							<p>The first classes offered by the Division of University Extension were designed to supplement the offerings of the Department of Education and were geared toward elementary and secondary school teachers in search of additional academic training. In 1940, a degree of bachelor of science in education was offered based on courses offered in the extension division.</p>
							<p>Enrollment in the extension division was open to anyone with a high school diploma. Faculty, staff, and family members could enroll in courses for a reduced fee. Graduate students could also take advantage of the division's offerings to supplement courses in the regular curriculum.</p>
							<p>Over the years, the Division of University Extension became the home for a number of programs which did not seem to fit elsewhere in the University structure, including a community lecture series in which faculty delivered lectures open to the general public, the Institute for Educational Guidance, and the Tufts College Nursery School. In 1944, the Extension Division co-sponsored with Mr. and Mrs. Donald R. MacJannet a six-week long "Vacation School of French" geared toward training workers to assist in rehabilitation efforts in post-war France. The Extension Division also administered Tufts' participation in the Lowell Institute Broadcasting Council, an organization founded in 1946 to make available to the general public via radio and television some of the resources of Boston-area institutions of higher education.</p>
							<p>The Extension Division administered Tufts' affiliations with several professional schools in the area, including the Bouv&#x00E9;-Boston School of Physical Education, the Boston School of Occupational Therapy, the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, the Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists, and the Nursery Training School of Boston, later renamed the Eliot Pearson School. Through their affiliation with the Tufts Extension Division, students at these schools could work toward the bachelor of science in education degree by taking Extension courses in addition to the coursework required by their own schools.</p>
							<p>As enrollments in the evening and weekend classes offered by the extension division began to decline in the late 1940s, the division was renamed the Division of Special Studies in 1949.Under its new name, the division focused on administering the affiliations with the professional schools under its aegis, rather than promoting course offerings for the general public.</p>
							<p>In 1956 the program with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts was changed to offer a B.F.A. degree after a four year course of study. </p>
							<p> Following a University-wide self study in 1958, the character, scope, and mission of the Division of Special Studies changed significantly. In an effort to improve the academic rigors of the affiliated programs, each was offered the option either of integration into the University or complete separation. The Eliot Pearson School became the Department of Child Study, and the Boston School of Occupational Therapy was integrated into Tufts. The Bouv&#x00E9;-Boston School and the Forsyth School joined with Northeastern University. Evening classes virtually ceased to be offered at this time. </p>
							<p> By 1960 the College of Special Studies had ten subdivisions and a total enrollment of more than 850 students, generating an annual gross income of almost a quarter of a million dollars. During the 1960s and 1970s, the College of Special Studies took on the administration of the university's overseas study programs. This function was transferred to the university in the 1970s.</p>
							<p>In 1990, the college established divisions of Professional and Continuing Studies and Graduate Special Student Program.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, the College of Special Studies operates in two main areas. It administers the dual-degree program with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, which offers a bachelors degree from Tufts and a bachelor of fine arts from the Museum School in a five year course of study. It also oversees the Office of Professional and Continuing Studies. The Office of Professional and Continuing Studies administers the Graduate Special Student Program which enables individuals with a baccalaureate degree to enroll in courses at Tufts to prepare for further study or simply to expand their knowledge of particular fields or disciplines. Within the program, the office administers a series of advanced professional certificate programs on selected topics, including a post-baccalaureate pre-medical program for students with little or no science work in their undergraduate curriculum who are interested in pursuing graduate study in the health sciences. </p>

Before the installation of a hand-pump mechanism in 1888, there were indications that the well on the site had been in use for many years. Replaced by a bubbler in the 1900s and renamed the Bubble, it was removed sometime after 1944, when the last references to it are made.</p>
							<p>The pump installed in 1888 was of an eight-sided log construction with a cast iron spout. A dipper was hung on the spout for drinking, until public drinking cups were banned. The pump was frequently painted by rival classes.</p>
							<p>The pump was frequently used to chastise members of the student body who were perceived to have flouted campus traditions. In the diary of Frank Smith, A1883, the entry for April 15, 1882 indicates that a student was put under the pump "for not conforming to resolutions on the campus....he saw he must submit and so went quietly."This punishment was inflicted by the sophomores, designated keepers of campus traditions.</p>
							<p>In approximately 1900 the well water was found to be polluted, it was suspected by fertilizers from the college barn applied to the lawns adjacent to the well. Following that discovery, the pump was replaced with the bubbler. The Bubble became as much of a campus landmark as the pump had been, and an introduction to the bubbler was part of every freshman's orientation.</p>
							<p>The last references to the bubbler are in 1944, when repairs were made to it. </p>

							<head>College Seal, 1857</head>
							<p> The official seal of Tufts College was created on July 17, 1857, by vote of the Board of Trustees. The design they adopted showed a dove with olive branch and an open Bible as symbols."Pax et Lux," or Peace and Light, was chosen as the aphorism, with the words "Sigillum Collegii Tuftensis" meaning seal of Tufts College. The original design showed the dove of peace with the olive branch in its beak flying downward toward an open Bible resting on a rocky eminence, like a hill. The sun's rays stream through clouds in the background. A modified version of this original seal still serves as the seal of the university as of 2000.</p>
							<p>Various changes were made to the seal over the years. In 1909 the words Holy Bible were translated to Biblia Sacra. Other minor changes were made to the aesthetics of the seal, as the clouds changed shape, the dove lost feathers, and the rocky eminence became a jumble of rocks.</p>
							<p>In 1939 President Leonard Carmichael introduced a coat of arms for general use rather than the seal, which was to be reserved strictly for official documents. Confusion in subsequent years over use of the shield and the seal prompted a move to reinstate the seal as the only official insignia of the University. </p>
							<p>In 1966 an updated design of the traditional seal was adopted, with several changes from the original design of 1857.The book featured is not ecclesiastical, and the rocky eminence was dropped altogether. The words circling the seal were updated to reflect the expanded scope of the University with the words Sigillum Universitatis Tuftensis used to replace the former designation of Collegii. This design is that which is still in use as of 1999. </p>

							<head>College Within, 1971-1977</head>
							<p> The College Within was a short-lived undergraduate program founded at Tufts University in 1971. It attempted to offer an alternative for students who couldn't function at their best in a conventional course framework.</p>
							<p>Attempts to create an individualized, interdisciplinary program date back to 1964, but it wasn't until 1970 that John Wade Professor of Modern Languages Seymour Simches' proposal to create an entity called the College Within was approved. College Within was organized in modules of five to seven students, with a faculty member and two graduate students as advisors. Students were allowed to pursue more independent work and explore areas of particular personal interest. Projects completed during College Within's first year included "Children's Education and Minority Culture in Depressed Areas of the United States," and "Perspective of Life in a Kibbutz." Students had to come up with a project topic, submit biweekly reports, and had to present their research once during the semester to their entire module. The length of the papers varied, with longer projects receiving more credits at the end of the semester.</p>
							<p>College Within met with problems after only one year in existence. The program experienced a fifty percent drop in enrollment after the first year, and by April, 1972, organizers were faced with the threat of mass desertion of the faculty. Many students didn't realize the amount of work necessary to keep up with the program, and a lack of publicity kept many upperclassmen from finding out about the program at all. Also, program administrators encountered a fear of unconventional programs among students worried about finding a job out of college in a tough market. Financially, College Within developed early problems. Although the program had won a $600,000 grant from the Spaulding-Potter Fund, it could only be used if Tufts raised matching funds. Tufts never solicited donors to match the grant, and it was lost. </p>
							<p>By the end of 1972, the College Within had begun to stabilize, and used its available funds to initiate a lecture series and sponsor a number of forums dealing with important campus issues. In fact, a non-university committee commissioned to study the program in 1974 found that College Within was better than it was reputed to be, although it did face major problems, including a university wide lack of integration between the various disciplines. By 1977, the College Within was forced to disband, citing a lack of funding and a lack of student interest. </p>

							<head>Commencement, 1856</head>
							<p> The first Tufts Commencement was held on the second Wednesday in July, 1856, although no students had yet met the requirements for graduation. Tufts College held a public dinner, and the audience listened to speeches by Thomas Jefferson Sawyer and Elmer Hewitt Capen. </p>
							<p>In 1857, Tufts College conferred degrees on graduating students for the first time. Continuing the tradition established a year earlier, the ceremony was held on the second Wednesday in July. The graduating students were each assigned a part in the ceremony, and delivered a speech in accordance with their class rank. From 1857 to 1878, each graduate delivered a speech, beginning with the Salutary and culminating in the Valedictory Oration. Until 1868, the Salutary and the Valedictory Address were delivered in Latin, and Latin was used to announce speakers, their topics, and even to bestow degrees. By 1878, however, the number of graduates was too high for each student to speak, as the ceremony would have lasted all day. Instead, the best students competed for a chance to be one of six student speakers at commencement. </p>
							<p>In 1861, faculty began electing marshals to participate in the ceremonies. In 1870, students were granted the privilege of electing the class marshals. At these early commencements, students dressed in formal clothes, but it was not until 1882 that students wore the now traditional cap and gown. Faculty did not begin wearing robes and hoods until 1902.</p>
							<p>From 1857 to 1879, graduates were listed in alphabetical order on the commencement program. In 1879, the administration decided to list students in order of scholarship, or ranking, to honor students for the academic achievements. Eventually, a compromise was reached, and now students are listed alphabetically by degree, with their academic honors noted after their names.</p>
							<p>Beginning with the first official commencement and lasting until 1875, the Mathetican Society, Tufts' first student organization, organized an oratory program to follow the commencement ceremonies. In 1875, the Association of Alumni took over the job, and presently, each college holds a luncheon for the graduates. </p>
							<p>In 1893, Henrietta Noble Brown became the first female to present an oration at commencement, and in 1896 Mary A. Livermore became the first female recipient of an honorary degree. </p>
							<p>Commencement continued in the same fashion until 1943, when student speakers were removed from the program. Instead, one of the honorary degree recipients delivered the commencement address. </p>
							<p>Presently, commencement begins at nine in the morning on a Saturday in May. After a processional featuring graduates from all of Tufts' colleges, the entire group listens to the commencement address and watches the presentation of honorary degrees. The College of Liberal Arts, the College of Engineering, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the College of Special Studies remain on the academic quad for degree presentation. The Fletcher School, School of Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, and the School of Nutrition Science and Policy, retire to separate locations for their own graduation ceremonies. Students have once again been integrated into the commencement program, with one student awarded the chance to speak at each school's ceremony. </p>

							<p> The Commons Club was formed at Tufts in December 1908. It was organized for the advancement of better spirit and closer relationship among alumni and undergraduates of Tufts College, and to provide a place of welcome to non-fraternal alumni who wish to visit the campus. In 1910, the Commons Club was provided with an official residence on Fairmount Street, later moving to a "chapter house" located at 37 Sawyer Avenue. The club was again moved to a residence on Broadway before returning to campus in 1921through the purchase of Tousey House on Professors Row.</p>
							<p>In 1924, the Commons Club affiliated with a local fraternity, Delta Phi Sigma, and in 1933 joined Alpha Kappa Pi (later Alpha Sigma Phi), a national fraternity. Although no symbol or badge remains from the club, according to the first Jumbo Book, published in 1917, the Commons Club possessed a coat of arms and the original club was founded at Wesleyan University in 1899, making Tufts' Commons Club part of a larger organization. </p>

							<p>Gussanda "Sanda" Countway (1882-1963), W1904, was born in 1882 in Somerville, Massachusetts. After graduating from Somerville Latin High School, Countway attended Tufts College, from which she was graduated 1904. Her education at Tufts was supported by her brother, Francis Countway, who was, at the time a bookkeeper for a local soap company. At Tufts "Gussie" as she was known then, played basketball and was active in the Alpha Xi Delta sorority. After her gradutation, she went on to a career teaching Latin at high schools in the Boston area, and for a short time, in Montana. </p>
							<p>When her brother became president of Lever Brothers in 1913, Sanda Countway gave up her work to devote herself to him and his interests. Neither Countway ever married, and many believe that Gussanda Countway had a great deal of influence over her brother's business as well as personal life. </p>
							<p>Thoughout her life Countway remained interested in education in general and women's education in particular. As early as 1909, she created the Alpha Xi Delta prize scholarship of $50 "to be awarded to the woman who most creditably completes the first three years of the Course in Education." After her brother's death, Countway created the Countway Charitable Foundation which was responsible for a $3.5 million gift to Harvard University to build the Countway Library at the Harvard Medical School, as well as $1 million for the Boston Science Museum, and $500,000 to the Boys Clubs of Boston.</p>
							<p>When Countway died in 1963, she left $100,000 to Tufts University and substantial gifts to Colby College, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, New England Deconess Hosptial and the Perkins School for the Blind. </p>

								<placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName> was constructed in 1931 to replace Goddard Gymnasium, which was inadequate for the increasing demands of a growing student population. It was named for then-president John Albert Cousens, and the building's architects were Andrews, Jones, Biscoe, and Whitmore. At the time of its construction, Cousens Gym was the most expensive building yet built on the Medford campus, at a cost of over half a million dollars.</p>
							<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01011"><head>Cousens Gymnasium, 1975</head></figure>Cousens Gym is built on land that was originally used as a pansy farm, consequently known as Pansy Park. The land was purchased by AMRAD Corporation, which ceded the land to the college when it ceased operations in the 1920s. AMRAD had built one factory building on the site, which was incorporated into the design of Cousens Gym and remains today as Halligan Hall.</p>
							<p>Cousens Gym was constructed to provide a large baseball cage, basketball courts, an indoor track, and locker and shower facilities. The main floor of the gym was large enough to hold special events and dances, and is still used for exams in large classes. Built-in bleachers provide seating on the basketball courts for about 500 people.</p>
							<p>Over the years Cousens Gym has undergone extensive renovations and additions. Hamilton Pool was added to the complex in 1945.In 1979, $850,000 was spent to add coeducational training and exercise rooms as well as women's showers and locker rooms to comply with Title IX requirements. A state-of-the-art fitness center was added in 1993 and a new intramural gym, Chase Gym, in 1996.The Gantcher Family Sports and Convocation Center was added to the complex in 1999.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, Cousens Gym continues to serve as the main athletic facility for the Medford campus. </p>

							<head>Crane Theological School, 1869-1968</head>
							<p> The Tufts College Divinity School was established in 1869, and in 1906 changed its name to the Crane Theological School. The school was closed in 1968, one year before its centennial. For most of its existence, the school was dogged by problems of inadequate endowment and low enrollment.</p>
							<p>The divinity school opened in 1869 with four students and two teachers. While the founders of Tufts College were thoroughly grounded in the Universalist faith, they had, in the interests of avoiding sectarianism in the college, resisted establishing a divinity school. The death of Sylvanus Packard, a trustee of the college, indirectly brought about the founding of the school. In his will Packard left approximately $300,000 to Tufts, of which a portion was to be used to establish a professorship of Christian theology. The trustees decided, in order to keep religious sectarianism out of the college, to establish a quasi-independent school of divinity associated with the college.</p>
							<p>The course of study offered by the divinity school was initially a three year course of study leading to a bachelor of divinity degree. Students were encouraged to have completed the full course of study toward a B.A. prior to entering the school. Such preparation was not required, however, and the poor performance of some students both before and after graduation dogged the school's reputation for many years.</p>
							<p>T.J. Sawyer was appointed the first Packard Professor in 1869.The Reverend Charles H. Leonard of Chelsea, grandfather of Leonard Carmichael, future president of Tufts, was the second faculty member, and succeeded Sawyer as dean in 1892.</p>
							<p>The divinity school was initially housed in Ballou Hall, in a room on the second floor. With the construction of <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName> in 1872, divinity students were offered accommodation there.1891 saw the building of separate quarters for the school with the construction of Miner and Paige halls. Miner Hall was built to provide classroom and office space for the school while Paige Hall served as a dormitory and chapel. The divinity school at this time reached one of its peaks with forty-four students enrolled for the 1892-93 academic year.</p>
							<p>The spacious new facilities added to the school were not long utilized to their full capacity, however, as enrollments showed a steady decline over subsequent years. After holding steady at approximately twenty students per year, enrollment dropped to a low of only nine students in 1906 with only one new student entering that year. Explanations for the lack of interest were sought and laid on the increasing secularization of American society, the waning of organized religion, and the call of other related vocations such as teaching and social work. Ongoing attempts to spur interest in the program by offering innovative courses in wide-ranging topics including psychology in ministry and molecular physics. </p>
							<p>In 1906 the school received a much-needed gift of $100,000 from Albert Crane, A1863, in memory of his father, Thomas Crane, a trustee from 1852 until his death in 1875.The school was subsequently renamed the Crane Theological School.</p>
							<p>Lee Sullivan McCollester became dean of the school in 1912 and brought the school through some of its leanest years, before retiring in 1932.During World War I, the school's buildings were taken for use as barracks and training facilities and Dean McCollester held classes for the handful of students enrolled in his living room for the duration of hostilities. By the mid 1920s enrollments were rising again, and in 1925 the school's name was officially changed to Tufts School of Religion - Crane Theological School. This name continued to be used until the 1960s when it was once again known simply as the Crane Theological School.</p>
							<p>There was ongoing debate about whether or not the school should be graduate level only or accept students straight out of secondary school to study for the ministry. For most of its existence the school was an undergraduate professional school, though in later years it succeeded in attracting a growing proportion of students at the graduate level. The school's leadership was concerned that requiring a B.A. for admission would deter worthy candidates from entering the school, while others at the university felt that adequate preparation for a ministerial career required the breadth of a B.A. as well as the specialized training of the B.D.For many years the school offered a combined B.A./S.T.B. (Bachelor of Sacred Theology) degree which was in effect a combined undergraduate and graduate degree. In 1954 the school became strictly a graduate school.</p>
							<p>Enrollment at the school reached an all-time high in 1937-38 with sixty students, and in 1941 the school hosted the annual Universalist Convention. Denominational representation in the student body had grown to encompass seven different faiths other than Universalism. While enrollment remained strong in the ensuing years, at roughly forty students, the school struggled to retain full-time faculty, with the majority of positions being filled by part-time faculty shared with the Faculty of Liberal Arts.</p>
							<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, discussions were ongoing within the denomination to merge the Crane School with the divinity school at St. Lawrence University, another Universalist school. Tufts was skeptical of the proposal because of the increased role that the denomination would play in the merged institution. An agreement could not be reached, however, and the plan was abandoned.</p>
							<p>The decision to close the school was reached by the trustees in June of 1967, to take place the following year. A number of factors contributed to the decision, though the trustees cited the school's failure to maintain its status in religious education. The continual deficit operations of the school undoubtedly also played a part at a time when the university as a whole was facing financial difficulties and the need for retrenchment. The closing of the school represented the growing distance of Tufts from its roots in the Universalist religion. </p>
							<p>Over the course of its ninety-nine year history, the Crane Theological School granted a total of 485 degrees. </p>

							<head>Crane, Thomas, 1803-75</head>
							<p>Thomas Crane (1803-75) served on the first Board of Trustees and was a gifted entrepreneur. In 1906 Albert Crane, Thomas' son, presented the Tufts College Divinity School with a gift of $100,000 in memory of his father. This occasioned the renaming of the institution, subsequently known as the Crane Theological School.</p>
							<p>Thomas Crane was born on October 3, 1803, on George's Island in Boston Harbor. His family moved to Quincy near Crane's Creek when the island was sold. His common school education consisted of a class of 204 children under the tutelage of one master. At fifteen Crane left to make a living. According to a twentieth century Quincy historian, Crane at this point had "a brilliant mind, but nothing to say."For some years, until his health failed him, Crane was a shoemaker. Next he moved on to granite cutting, and eventually, at the age of twenty-six, he took his trade to New York.</p>
							<p>With two partners he purchased a stone-quarry, and began to accumulate wealth. Crane foresaw that land around the growing New York City would soon be in short supply, and after the New York fire he purchased several acres. He bought out his stone-quarry partners, and his land purchases were highly profitable. His fortune made, Thomas Crane turned his attention to education.

							<head>Crook, Dorothea J., 1903-2000</head>
							<p> Dorothea Johannsen Crook (1903-2000) was the first woman to head a department at Tufts University.</p>
							<p>Born in Ithaca, New York, on October 14, 1903, Dorothea Johannsen received her primary education at Ithaca High School before enrolling at Cornell. She received her B.A. from Cornell in 1924 and transferred to Clark University, where she received an M.A. in 1927 and her Ph. D. in 1929. She immediately began teaching, first as an instructor at Wellesley from 1929 to 1930, and then as an instructor at the University of Rochester from 1930 to 1931. Johannsen then took a position at Skidmore, serving as associate professor from 1931 to 1945. While at Skidmore, she married Mason Crook. The two had met as graduate students at Clark. </p>
							<p>In 1946, Crook was hired at Tufts University. She served as a lecturer in psychologyfor two years before being promoted to assistant professor in 1948. In 1953, Crook was appointed Hunt Professor of Psychology, making her the first female to rise through the faculty ranks to full professor. </p>
							<p>In 1955 and 1956, Crook was a member of the Governor's Commission on Juvenile Delinquency. She spoke to parents statewide about the importance of disciplined children. From 1957 to 1958, Crook was on sabbatical leave as a Research Associate of the Institute of Experimental Psychology. She spent the year researching at the Center for Child Study at Yale University. </p>
							<p>Upon returning to Tufts in 1959 Crook was promoted to chairwoman of the department of Psychology. She was the first woman promoted to department chair in the entire one hundred and seven-year history of Tufts.</p>
							<p> Outside of the classroom, Crook published numerous articles, and was co-author of the Tufts Handbook for Human Engineering Data, a study that brought Tufts much recognition in the late 1940's. Crook retired in 1968 to devote her time to writing a history of psychology. She died in Maryland on March 5, 2000. </p>

							<p>
								<placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> was constructed in 1893 as a multi-purpose building in part to compensate for the loss of the dining hall from <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>, which was to be taken for additional dormitory rooms. The architect of the building was George A. Clough. The new building, known for some ten years as the Commons building, was intended to have, besides the men's dining room, two or three stores and rooms for students. The dining hall was for many years known as the Dive. In 1904, the building was renamed <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> for James Otis Curtis, Medford shipbuilder and Tufts trustee from 1856 to 1890. On April 2, 1977, the building was heavily damaged by fire caused by faulty wiring.</p>
							<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00879"><head> Curtis Hall (the "Commons Building") in 1902</head></figure>One of the original purposes of the building and one which has been in continuous use is the Post Office, which had previously been located in a small wooden building at the same site. For many decades, it served the needs of the entire institution as an independent unit, with all mail addressed to "Tufts College, Massachusetts." Among the other concessions the building has housed have been a bicycle repair shop, the Bookstore, a restaurant, the Tufts College Publishing Association - publishers of the Weekly and the Tuftonian, the Tufts College Press, the Maintenance Department carpentry shop, and the Department of Civil Engineering's Strength of Materials Laboratory.</p>
							<p>The dining hall housed in Curtis was at various times a cooperative enterprise under student management, College operated, and a private concession. About 1900, a meal ticket good for three meals a day for a full week cost $3.50, prompting student complaints about high prices.</p>
							<p>During World War I, the main building was a mess hall for members of the Student Army Training Corps unit stationed at Tufts. During World War II, it was a Navy mess hall, serving well over 500 at a time. The upper floors served as housing for both students and employees, and in the 1950s, four Jackson sororities were assigned rooms in the building.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> continues to be used as a multi-purpose building. The US Postal Service maintains an office there, and in 1997, use of the building for dining purposes resumed after a hiatus with the opening of Brown and Brew, a coffee house run by Dining Services. Rehearsal space for student performing groups is located in the building. Offices for the Tufts Daily and the Observer are both located there, as well as other student publications, such as the Zamboni. It is also the home of WMFO, Tufts student-run radio station, and TUTV, the student-run television station. The Center for Engineering Education Outreach and the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-based Modeling are both located there. Finally, the Office of the Protestant Chaplaincy is housed in <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName>. </p>

							<p> Charles A. Dana (1881-1975), H1964, was a noted industrialist and philanthropist who donated $750,000 to Tufts for the construction of the Dana Biology Laboratories on the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>Dana was born on April 21, 1881, in New York City. He received his education at Colombia University, where he received a B.A. and a law degree. After his graduation, Dana worked as a prosecuting attorney for the New York District Attorney's office before moving on to a career in politics. Using the public exposure he gained from his position with the District Attorney, Dana successfully campaigned for a seat in the New York state legislature, where he served three terms. He became a close associate of both New York governor C.E. Hughes and future president Theodore Roosevelt. Dana later managed one of Roosevelt's presidential campaigns.</p>
							<p>In 1914, Dana left politics to start an industrial career. By 1946, Dana had established the Dana Corporation, a complex of five auto parts companies that brought in annual revenues of over $150 million. It was with these funds that he started his career as a philanthropist.</p>
							<p>Dana became known for his generosity to hospitals and small universities. In 1963, Dana donated $750,000 to Tufts University in order to finance the construction of Dana Laboratories, which was built adjoining Barnum Hall.</p>
							<p>Dana died in November 1975 at the age of ninety-four. </p>

The award is given annually to a junior economics major who, in the judgment of the Department of Economics, should be encouraged to pursue graduate studies in economics and whose contributions to the Tufts community reflect the loyalty and commitment which his students and peers appreciated in Daniel Ounjian.</p>
							<p>Daniel Ounjian was born June 5, 1929, to Armenian immigrants, Mihran and Armenouhie Ounjian. After serving in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War as a Russian linguist and crypto-analyst, he studied economics at Tufts and graduated cum laude in 1957. In 1962 he returned to Tufts as instructor of economics, and in 1965 became assistant professor. The following year he received a doctorate from Harvard. In 1968, he was promoted to associate professor, and in 1975, to full professor. His specialties were public financing and investment banking. His first love was always the classroom and the relationships he established with his students. In 1975 he received the Seymour Oliver Simches Award for Distinguished Teaching and Service to the University. He was deputy chair of the Economics Department for eight years, acting chair for two years, and chair for eleven years. He died December 31, 1993, after a long battle with cancer. </p>

							<head>de Pacheco, Kaye MacKinnon, ca. 1910-ca. 1985</head>
							<p>Kaye Mackinnon de Pacheco (ca.1910-ca.1985), H1978, J1931, graduated with a degree in English from Jackson College in 1931.Shortly after her graduation she launched a long and distinguished career in ballet, making her international debut with the Ballet Russe of Bronislava Nijinski in Paris.</p>
							<p>MacKinnon was born in Boston, but began dancing as a child in Canada. Back in Massachusetts, she studied the art throughout prep school and her college years. At Tufts she pursued other interests as well. She was a member of the tennis team and the Weekly, served a stint as class vice-president, acted in plays and operettas, and competed in the Goddard Prize readings. MacKinnon was chosen by her peers to represent Tufts at Yale's 1930 Model League of Nations. She dabbled in hockey, baseball, and the glee and press clubs. Adept at her studies, she earned honors in three subjects and Phi Beta Kappa recognition. It is not surprising to find that her fellow classmates voted MacKinnon Most All-Around and Most Ambitious in the class.</p>
							<p>She lived up to expectations in a novel way. Following her marriage to composer Luis Pacheco in France, the couple was forced to leave on the eve of the Second World War. Compelled by circumstance to cancel a promising contract with a noted Parisian theater, it seemed that the diminutive dancer's career was, at least for the moment, on hold. The woman who had once studied with Preobrajenska, Trefilova, and Wigman now headed to Peru, a land lacking in ballet opportunities and interest. Her new homeland was to become the site of her greatest triumphs. In Peru MacKinnon created the Ballet Peruana and the Escuela del Ballet Peruano. Both School and Ballet were recognized by the Peruvian government in 1952, and in 1960 MacKinnon was awarded a silver medal and diploma by the Municipality of Lima for "outstanding artistic and pedagogical achievement."</p>
							<p>The creation of an official ballet school and company in a foreign country is not easy. To create one in a culture where ballet was only tenuously known, and where men regarded the art as a womanly occupation, was no small feat for MacKinnon. Yet, by 1960 MacKinnon was choosing from among thousands of candidates for entry into her school - men included. In 1978 Tufts awarded MacKinnon an honorary doctorate for her creation of the Ballet Peruana, an event so appreciated by her adopted country that the show "24 Hours" covered the ceremony from Lima. In the interview, Mrs. MacKinnon admitted that as a child she had, out of embarrassment, taken ballet classes in secret.</p>
							<p>Kaye MacKinnon de Pacheco died in the mid-1980s, still a resident of her adopted Peru.</p>

He then returned to Massachusetts to study for two terms at Framingham Academy and completed his general education under the Reverend Doctor Crane, studying Greek.</p>
							<p>Choosing medicine as his career, Dean studied under two prominent Boston doctors before receiving his medical degree from the Curators of the Massachusetts Medical Society in 1809.He then practiced medicine in Boston and Medway from 1812 to 1817, during which time he married Caroline Francoeur, who died in 1866.</p>
							<p>From 1817 to 1826, Dean relinquished his medical practice, becoming the superintendent of the Medway Cotton Manufactory. He then moved on to industrial endeavors in Manchester, New Hampshire, taking charge of the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company. His development of the mill directly affected the surrounding community, encouraging the population's growth from a few hundred to several thousand people. He continued to serve as president of the corporation until his death almost fifty years later.</p>
							<p>In 1834, Dean returned to Framingham, serving as presidentof the Framingham Bank and becoming active in community affairs, including the Universalist Church. From 1844 to 1851, Dean had permanent residences in Boston and then Franklin. In 1868, he married Louisa C. Hawes, a widow from Wrentham.</p>
							<p>Dean's interest in higher education prompted him to offer his estate in Franklin in 1851 as a possible site for the Universalist Church's first institution of higher learning, which was chartered as Tufts College the following year. Although the school was eventually located on land donated by Charles Tufts in Somerville and Medford, Dean continued his affiliation with the endeavor, serving as one of the original provisional trustees elected in 1851. From 1852 until his death on December 5, 1871, Dean served as the president of the Tufts Board of Trustees.</p>
							<p>In 1865, a coeducational preparatory school was also chartered under the Universalist Church in Franklin, intended to be a "feeder" school for Tufts. Dean Academy, built on land again offered by Dean, later became Dean Junior College, now known as Dean College. He also was a benefactor of the Universalist Church of Franklin, and the public libraries of Medway, Franklin, and Manchester, New Hampshire.</p>
							<p>In 1886, Dean Hall, a men's dormitory on the Medford campus was built and named in his honor. It was razed in 1963 to make way for additional facilities for the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. </p>

Dearborn, 1891</head></figure>Heman Allen Dearborn (1831-1897), A1858, was a dedicated alumnus, faculty member, administrator, and benefactor of Tufts College and had the distinction of being the institution's first valedictorian.</p>
							<p>Dearborn was born in Weare, New Hampshire, on May 18, 1831.He attended public school and completed three terms at Francestown Academy before he began teaching at the age of seventeen. He entered Tufts College in 1855 as a junior, graduating two years later as valedictorian of the first class to receive degrees from the college. As an undergraduate, he taught in Arlington, Massachusetts. He continued at this post for three years following his graduation. He married in 1858.</p>
							<p>In 1864, he returned to Tufts from a position as principal of the Clinton Liberal Institute. In addition to being Professor of Latin Language and Literature, Dearborn served as secretary of the faculty from 1881-1894. He then became the college's registrar from 1895-1897. He had also acted as assistant to the college's treasurer for a period of time. In 1878, he traveled through Europe with his wife, Julia, collecting Roman photographs and artifacts for use in his classes. The Dearborns resided at 72 Professors Row, and their house became known as Dearborn House. He founded the Scholarship of the Class of 1857 for the benefit of women students. </p>
							<p>In 1897, Dearborn died unexpectedly at home following a brief illness. At the time of his death, he was the oldest living graduate of the college and, as result of his paternal interest in the students, was referred to as "father of the freshmen." He ordered in his will that his estate be placed in trust, with its profits being paid annually to his wife. Following her death, it was to be bequeathed to the Trustees of Tufts College, to be used as the Trustees saw fit.</p>
							<p>In 1910, the Class of 1900 erected the first gate on campus, which leads from Professors Row to Ballou Hall, in memory of Dearborn. </p>

							<head>Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology, 1893</head>
							<p> Classic anatomy with dissection and histology has been taught at the medical school since 1893. Since that time the department has maintained a reputation for having a strong teaching program.</p>
							<p>The department offers courses in gross anatomy, neuroanatomy, histology, and cellular biology and includes nineteen faculty members, thirteen of whom teach both medical and dental students. Over the years, members of the department have been the recipients of a number of basic science teaching awards presented by graduating students.</p>
							<p>Until 1964 research in this department was very modest and focused mainly on anatomical descriptions and variations. However, under the leadership of Dr. Lauro Cavazos, who became professor and chairman that year, the department's direction changed markedly. For one thing, it began to incorporate the teaching of cellular biology and was renamed to that effect. In addition, Dr. Cavazos saw to it that a significant research enterprise was developed and modern laboratories were constructed.</p>
							<p>The great majority of the department's research focuses on the cellular phenomena of reproduction, embryonic development, and vascular and skin healing. Investigators possess expertise in the techniques of molecular and cellular biology, protein and polysaccharide biochemistry, immunology, transgenic manipulation, and computer-based imaging.</p>
							<p>In 1992 the department's total research budget amounted to more than $4.6 million (compared to $245,000 in 1978). Overall, faculty have been quite successful in obtaining research support: the department currently ranks in the nation's top ten anatomy departments in terms of NIH funding. One member of the faculty, Dr. Thomas E Linsenmayer, has been presented with the National Institute of Eye Research's prestigious MERIT Award. In recent years the department has received a program project award to study the molecular and cellular aspects of early limb development as well as a Center Grant in Reproductive Biology. The graduate program in anatomy has also been successful and has attracted increasing numbers of students. </p>

							<head>Department of Anesthesia, 1970</head>
							<p> Although anesthetists have served on Tufts' faculty since 1893, the medical school did not establish a formal division or teaching program of anesthesia until 1949. That year Dr. Benjamin Etsten became the first full-time chair of the school's division and of the New England Medical Center Hospital's service. He subsequently recruited faculty for teaching, research, and clinical anesthesia. He also organized teaching programs for third-year students at the New England Medical Center, the Boston Veteran's Administration, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and the Boston City Hospital; developed electives for students in their fourth year; and established a residency program.</p>
							<p>In 1970 departmental status was achieved and Dr. Etsten became the first chair. By the time that he retired in 1974, the department had grown from one staff anesthesiologist and four residents to a group of ten staff members and fifteen residents.</p>
							<p>In 1975 Dr. Kurt Schmidt was appointed chairman. The next fourteen years saw additional growth in the department's faculty along with the modernization of what was an already highly technical specialty. In keeping with a national trend, the residency program began to attract increasing numbers of American medical school graduates.</p>
							<p>During this time the department's basic and clinical anesthesia research continued and was strengthened by the establishment of the Eleanor Brooks Saltonstall Professorship for Research in Anesthesia and Pain Control. The addition of the new Boston Floating Hospital, built in 1982, brought a surge in clinical activity. Faculty members became involved in cardiac interventions, vascular reconstructive surgery, major organ transplantation, and major joint replacements-as well as out-patient surgery.</p>
							<p>In 1983 Dr. Richard Kream assumed leadership of the research laboratory. Under his aegis, several important clinical contributions have been made, ranging from studies on the temperature regulation of patients under anesthesia to alterations in patients undergoing vascular and cardiac surgery.</p>
							<p>In 1991 Dr. Heinreich Wurm, a highly skilled anesthetist and a dedicated teacher, became the department's third chair. Dr. Wurm holds an M.D. degree from the University of T&#x00FC;bingen. He received his anesthesia training at T#x00FC;bingen and the Peter Bent Brigham and Children's Hospitals. Under his leadership, the program has continued to include a week in the third-year surgical curriculum as well as a fourth-year elective in the major teaching hospitals. </p>

							<head>Department of Art and Art History, 1930</head>
							<p> The Department of Art and Art History was established in 1930, then officially entitled the Department of Fine Arts. Although the first art class was offered at Tufts in 1899, it was not until 1930 that Tufts committed enough money to fund an entire department. </p>
							<p>The first classes in fine arts began at Tufts in 1899. Professor Whittemore, who was designated as "Instructor in the History of Art", taught the classes, which at the time totaled only two. Tufts continued to offer various art classes throughout the early twentieth century, and in 1930 the Department of Fine Arts was formally established under the leadership of Professor Edwin H. Wright. </p>
							<p>Wright was a professor of architecture and city planning in the Department of Civil Engineering, but also had expertise in the fields of art and art history. When the department began official operations in the spring of 1931, Wright opened up the courses to both liberal arts and engineering students. </p>
							<p>In 1966, the Department of Fine Arts underwent the first in a series of major changes. The course requirements for a major in arts were shifted to make it easier for students to distinguish between a path in studio art and a path in art history. The shift emphasized courses focusing in the more academic areas of art, but did not decrease the number of creative art classes. </p>
							<p>During this period, students had to take creative and studio art courses at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, and those who focused on art history had to take all their classes at Tufts. Unfortunately, however, one could not major in art history specifically, but instead had to take fifteen credits in art history, and fifteen credits in studio art. This required all art majors to schedule their classes with enough time between to commute to and from the Museum School. Tufts also did not offer a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree, and the Wessell Library had only very limited art history materials. As a result, students raised a number of complaints about the department in 1967, including a group of art majors who signed a petition demanding a number of improvements.</p>
							<p>The student petition called for more studio space at Tufts, a bus to the Museum School, and a readjustment of major credits. Although slight improvements were made, students remained unhappy with the department. In 1972, Tufts established a visiting committee to investigate student complaints and make some recommendations about improving the department. The committee recommended that the department be allocated more space and library facilities. They also recommended that more faculty be hired, and that the department's relationship with the Museum School be clarified.</p>
							<p>In an attempt to meet one of the committee's recommendations, the Department of Fine Arts vacated its former home in Cohen Arts Center and moved to 11 Talbot Avenue in 1975. The new department home held more office space, a forty-person classroom in the basement, and a large seminar room on the top floor for classes and discussion sessions. Their old space was converted into soundproof practice rooms for the Department of Music. </p>
							<p>The Department of Fine Arts received a grant of $35,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities to work on a project entitled "Stained Glass in New England," in 1977.The grant provided funding for two seminar courses in the subject, and was the first grant ever awarded to the department. </p>
							<p>The Department of Fine Arts became the Department of Art during the mid-1980s, only to be renamed the Department of Art and Art History in the following decade. As of 2001, the Department of Art and Art History still maintains its offices at 11 Talbot Avenue, along with studio space in Lane Hall. </p>

							<head>Department of Biochemistry, 1893</head>
							<p> During its first fifty years the Department of Biochemistry (which was called "medical chemistry" from 1893 to 1910 and "biological chemistry" from 1910 until 1937) sponsored a lecture and laboratory course for medical students but provided no graduate program and conducted very little research. However, the arrival of Dr. Gerhard Schmidt in 1940 marked a great change for the medical school and the New England Medical Center Hospital. Dr. Schmidt was the first distinguished biochemist to join Tufts' faculty, having been invited by Dr. Siegfried Thannhauser to establish a research laboratory for the Department of Medicine.</p>
							<p>In 1949 Dr. Halvor N. Christensen became chairman of the renamed Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition and began a program of modernization. He helped oversee the move of the department to Harrison Avenue as well as the construction of a new teaching laboratory where students could perform chemical analyses of blood, urine, and gastric fluids. Moreover, he strengthened the course of study with the assistance of Drs. Schmidt and William Fishman and was successful in recruiting faculty members with research interests. He also initiated a graduate training program.</p>
							<p>Dr. Alton Meisrer, who was appointed professor and chair of the department in 1955, recruited additional research-oriented faculty. He also ensured that laboratory space was renovated and equipped with modern instruments. During his tenure, the graduate program flourished due to NIH training grant support. Its enrollment grew from nine students in 1957 to twenty-two in 1965. These graduates went on to assume leadership positions in departments throughout the country.</p>
							<p>In 1967 Dr. Morris Friedkin, who had been head of the pharmacology department since 1958, became chair of biochemistry. He subsequently recruited several faculty members into the department. The following year Dr. Friedkin moved to California and Dr. Schmidt was named acting chair.</p>
							<p>In 1969 Dr. Henry Mautner was recruited to create a combined department of biochemistry and pharmacology. After Dr. Mautner stepped down in 1984, Dr. David Stollar, a distinguished biochemist with an international reputation, was named acting chair, and two searches were organized in order to recruit leaders of separate departments of pharmacology and biochemistry, in accordance with the recommendation of review committees. In 1986 Dr. Stollar was named chairman of biochemistry and Dr. Louis Shuster was appointed the acting chair of pharmacology. Dr. Stollar received his M.D. degree in 1959 from the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. After postdoctoral education in Saskatoon, Canada and Brandeis University, he joined the Tufts faculty in 1964.</p>
							<p>Drs. Shuster, North, Theoharides, and Thomson formed the nucleus of the pharmacology department. The remainder of the faculty of the former joint department remained involved with biochemistry. Under Dr. Stollar's leadership, biochemistry laboratories were renovated, new research equipment was purchased, additional faculty were recruited, and the graduate program was strengthened. </p>

							<p>Although courses in chemistry were first offered in 1865, it was not until 1882 that it was officially designated as a department. Professor Arthur Michael, at the time the only chemistry professor at Tufts, was designated head of the department.

							<p>In 1894, Tufts awarded its first B.S. in chemistry, making it one of the earliest schools to offer such a degree. The degree program also made Tufts one of the first schools officially accredited by the American Chemical Society. </p>
							<p>By 1915, twenty-five percent of Tufts' undergraduate population was majoring in chemistry and, by 1923, the department had so completely outgrown its facilities that a new building was constructed. The Pearson Chemical Laboratory became the new home of the department offices, and also included classroom and laboratory space. Pearson remained the sole chemistry building on campus until the 1965 construction of the Arthur Michael Chemistry Laboratory expanded research facilities and opportunities. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, the Department of Chemistry remains in Pearson and Michael Laboratories, and chemistry remains a popular major at Tufts. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Community Health, 1930" id="D00017">
							<head>Department of Community Health, 1930</head>
							<p> The roots of Tufts' Department of Community Health go back to 1930, when the medical school established a Department of Preventive Medicine with Commonwealth Fund support, appointing Dr. Dwight O'Hara as the first professor. When Dr. O'Hara retired in 1957, the department was reorganized under the leadership of Drs. Count Gibson and H. Jack Geiger, and its name was changed to "community health and social medicine." Drs. Gibson and Geiger adopted a community-oriented focus and went on to initiate a variety of outreach activities, including the direct delivery of health services to under-served populations. These efforts led to the development of the Columbia Point and Mound Bayou projects, for which the department attained national recognition.</p>
							<p>At this time the department supervised both teaching programs, such as the Home Medical Service, and preceptorships in neighborhood clinics and physicians' offices; however, it had few other educational responsibilities. Thus, when Drs. Gibson and Geiger left Tufts in 1969 and 1971, respectively, the department was abolished and its residual activities were absorbed into the Community Health Group under the aegis of the Dean's Office. The Home Medical Service was discontinued, and teaching activities were limited to elective seminars and presentations in conjunction with other courses.</p>
							<p>However, in 1977 Dean Lauro Cavazos asked Dr. Morton Madoff to help evaluate the activities of the Community Health Group and to begin the development of a program for teaching, research, and service. Over the next few years, the Community Health Group undertook a number of initiatives, including the management of the Tufts' Maine Area Health Education Center Program; the development of a health maintenance organization - the Tufts Associated Health Plan; the establishment of a program of family medicine; the organization of a primary care internal medicine residency program, in cooperation with the Faulkner Hospital; the institution of a course in biostatistics and epidemiology; and the initiation of a primary care preceptorship program for first- and second-year medical students.</p>
							<p>In 1980, when the Department of Community Health was reinstated, Dr. Madoff, who had been serving as director of the Community Health Group, was appointed acting chair. He was appointed chairman in 1981. Under his leadership, significant curriculum changes were instituted, including the addition of a lecture series on community health issues and of required courses in ethics, the organization and financing of health care, and family medicine. With the help of Area Health Education Center funding, a primary care clerkship was initiated at the Baystate Medical Center, clerkships in family practice programs were established in Maine, and a pediatric clinical clerkship was developed at the Eastern Maine Medical Center. In 1986 the department introduced the combined M.D./M.P.H. program, which permits a select number of medical students to receive both the doctor of medicine and master of public health degrees in four years. This program is designed to respond to the growing need for physicians to possess an understanding of health promotion, disease prevention, epidemiology, the environment, health planning, and global health problems. The course recently received full national accreditation.</p>
							<p>In recent years the Department of Community Health has also sponsored numerous research and service activities, such as a program for delivering health services to the institutionalized mentally retarded (in cooperation with the Department of Neurology); a research project focusing on the physician's role in health promotion and disease prevention; and a variety of environmental studies (in partnership with Tufts' Center for Environmental Management). From 1983 to 1986 the department was also responsible for developing and implementing the human health component of the Tufts/Niger Integrated Livestock Project. Moreover, it continues to be the major link to the Tufts Associated Health Plan and utilizes the plan as a laboratory for health services research.</p>
							<p>In 1987 the department was selected to be one of six recipients of a five-year Pew/Rockefeller Health of the Public Award, designed to encourage the development of a population-based perspective. Within the context of this program first- and second-year students participate in a variety of health-related activities that are not part of the regular curriculum but which provide them with exposure to the area of public health. This program has also made it possible for the department to initiate a required ambulatory care clerkship in the clinical years and to introduce courses in addiction medicine, nutrition, and immigrant and refugee health care. The primary mission of the Department of Community Health continues to be that of providing students with the skills, knowledge, and perspectives needed to understand the link between social, physical, and economic environments and the health of individual patients. </p>

							<head>Department of Dermatology, 1897</head>
							<p> Dermatology was taught to Tufts' senior medical students at the Boston City and Carney Hospitals as early as 1897. The first chair of the department, Dr. James S. Howe, was appointed in 1903. He was succeeded by Drs. Francis J. Keany, Townsend W. Thorndike, and William P. Boardman, all of whom were engaged in private practice.</p>
							<p>Dr. John G. Downing, who was professor and chairman from 1944 to 1952, was responsible for establishing a national and international reputation for the department as a result of his interest in the field of industrial dermatology. He also organized a residency at the Boston City Hospital. Dr. Bernard Appel, who led the department from 1952 to 1961, helped develop a program for third-year students that involved both lectures and clinics and allowed them to visit the Boston City Hospital for ward walks, laboratory sessions, and conferences. During Dr. Appel's tenure, faculty members published a number of clinical studies.</p>
							<p>In 1961 Dr. Walter F. Lever became the first full-time chair of the department and the director of the services at the Boston City Hospital and the Boston Dispensary. An eminent dermatopathologist and a pioneer in the study of blistering diseases, he developed both a full-time and part-time faculty for teaching and research and established laboratories at the medical school, the Boston Dispensary, and the Boston City Hospital. During this time, the department was also able to obtain federal support for research. By the time Dr. Lever retired in 1977, Tufts possessed a strong department of dermatology, despite the fact that the school had lost the Boston City Hospital's service in 1974.</p>
							<p>In 1980 Dr. David S. Feingold, a graduate of Harvard Medical School who had previously been a professor of dermatology at Boston University and chief of that section at the Boston V. A. Medical Center, was appointed professor and chair of Tufts' department and chief at the New England Medical Center. He has since brought the department to an outstanding level of teaching, research, and patient care. The faculty has grown to include nine physicians who specialize in the divisions of general dermatology, dermatological surgery, and dermatological research. Research laboratories have been established in the New England Medical Center's Ziskind Building. The research enterprise developed by Dr. Lever and enhanced by Dr. Feingold and his faculty has earned national recognition for the department. </p>

							<head>The Department of Economics, 1946</head>
							<p> Although economics has been taught at Tufts since 1893, an autonomous Department of Economics was not established until 1946. </p>
							<p>In 1902, under the aegis of Professor Albert Metcalf and President Elmer Capen, the Department of Economics and Sociology was officially founded. Professor Metcalf taught the bulk of the courses, with President Capen aiding in the upper-level seminar courses. Prior to 1902, all economics classes had been offered through the Department of Political Science, and were taught almost exclusively by President Capen. After spring semester in 1903, however, the Department of Economics and Sociology was disbanded. Economics courses were once again left to the auspices of the Department of Political Science.</p>
							<p>Due largely to the fundraising efforts of Austin Fletcher A1876, economics returned to Tufts in the 1920s. Henry J. Braker, a client and close friend of Fletcher, visited Tufts in 1905 to watch Fletcher speak at the college semi-centennial, and was so impressed with the campus that he left the college $500,000 in his will. From 1907 through Fletcher's death in 1923, Braker's grant was a source of much controversy. In his will, Braker earmarked the funds for the establishment of a school of commerce, accounts, and finance, but added a clause stating that if such facilities already existed, his grant could be used to maintain and expand any such program. </p>
							<p>In 1907, discussion about how to use Braker's grant led to plans to build a Braker School for Business, but the plan languished after Tufts' President Hamilton's death. His successor, President Bumpus, then discussed the possibilities of opening a school of public affairs in Boston with the funds. Fletcher supported this plan, and from 1920 through his death in 1923, he searched for a dean to head the new school. The Tufts College Trustees, however, never voted to implement the plan. Instead, they voted in 1920 to establish a Braker School of Business Administration in association with the College of Liberal Arts. Fletcher strongly opposed any connection with liberal arts, and fought the decision until his death.</p>
							<p>After Fletcher's death, President Cousens finally came up with a solution to the Braker dilemma. The original Department of Economics and Sociology had existed during Braker's lifetime, and his will stated that his bequest could be used to support a previously founded program. Cousens was able to reconvene a department using Braker's funds.</p>
							<p>In 1924, the Department of Economics and Sociology was reformed under the guidance of Professor Mayer, who was named department chair. From 1924 through the onset of World War II, the department was quite successful, and saw a large increase in the number of students seeking economics degrees. Cousens used Braker's funds to establish a total of eight graduate teaching fellowships, which greatly improved the teaching capabilities of the department. Also, in 1927, the Trustees voted to use $203,000 worth of Braker's interest to build Braker Hall, which became home to the department. </p>
							<p>World War II, however, had a major impact on the department. Many students enlisted in the army, and Tufts also lost a number of professors to the war effort. By 1944, the Department of Economics and Sociology had only two professors on its staff. </p>
							<p>After the war, the outlook improved for the department. In 1946, the Department of Economics, under the guidance of Professor Manly, ended its affiliation with the Department of Sociology, and was, for the first time, its own entity. Through the next twenty years, the popularity of economics courses increased dramatically. To appease the many students double-majoring in economics and a related field, credit requirements for graduation were reduced in 1963 from thirty credits to twenty-four. </p>
							<p>By 1974, the economics faculty was well known for the varied publications of its members, and in the same year, the graduate program at the Department of Economics ranked in the top forty-five nationally. Only two years later, however, the department would face many challenges.</p>
							<p>With the vast increase in economics students came a crunch for professors. Already, the student to faculty ratio in the Department of Economics was higher than any other department in the university, and professors were forced to take on large numbers of advisees each year. In 1976, five members of the twelve-member department decided to leave Tufts, citing below average funds for the department and skyrocketing amounts of students. Tufts had hired two new economics professors that year, but this was insufficient to meet the needs of the department.</p>
							<p>By the early 1980's the Department of Economics had regained a footing as a strong and popular department. In 1988, the department received its first endowed chair on a gift from Joseph Neubauer, raising the prominence of the department in the national arena.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, the Department of Economics, currently located in Braker Hall, continues to attract a huge number of students each year. </p>

							<head>Department of Medicine, 1893</head>
							<p> The Department of Medicine was among the first departments of the School of Medicine. From 1893 to 1948 the chair of the Department of Medicine served only a part-time role at Tufts while continuing in private practice. During these years student teaching was provided at the Boston Dispensary, the Boston City Hospital, the Carney Hospital, and St. Elizabeth's Hospital, while the department's research was primarily clinical. After the Pratt Diagnostic Clinic opened in 1938, students were taught at the New England Medical Center with increasing frequency.</p>
							<p>In 1930s and 1940s the Departments of Medicine at both Tufts and the New England Medical Center were enhanced by the addition of a number of distinguished physicians who had fled Germany, including Drs. Siegfried Thannhauser, Gerhard Schmidt, Heinrich Brugsch, Joseph Igersheimer, and Alfred Hauptmann. The department was further strengthened by the arrival of Drs. Edwin Astwood, William Dameshek and William Fishman. After Dr. Samuel Proger was named professor and chair at the school and physician-in-chief at the New England Medical Center in 1948, he further strengthened the department at Tufts by recruiting a number of outstanding faculty members, among them, Drs. Marshall Kaplan, Jerome Kassirer, Herbert Levine, Seymour Reichlin, Robert Schwartz, William Schwartz, and Louis Weinstein.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Proger retired in 1971, Dr. William Schwartz became chairman at the school and physician-in-chief at the New England Medical Center. He served in that capacity until 1976, when he was named Tufts' first Vannevar Bush University Professor. Dr. Kassirer then became acting chair.</p>
							<p>The following year Dr. Sheldon M. Wolff, one of the nation's most highly regarded medical scientists, was appointed chairman at Tufts and physician-in-chief at the New England Medical Center. He proceeded to build upon the accomplishments of his predecessors and has been able to develop a first-rate department that provides students with an excellent education and offers clinical training at all of the school's major teaching hospitals. Since Dr. Wolff became chairman, the number of departmental faculty has increased in all of those hospitals. At the New England Medical Center the number of full-time staff has grown from 50 to 138, the number of house staff from 28 to 56, the number of clinical fellows from 35 to 50, and the number of research fellows from 41 to 110. Research space has expanded from 25,000 to 125,000 square feet, and research support has increased from $2 million to $21 million. The total budget of the department has risen from $5 million to over $40 million. </p>

							<head>Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, 1962</head>
							<p> The medical school's Department of Microbiology was first established in 1962, although prior to that time microbiology courses had been offered through the pathology department. The creation of the department was a result of Dean Joseph Hayman's efforts to strengthen the basic science departments. Dr. James T. Park, a well-known microbial biochemist, was recruited to become the first department chair. Dr. Park went on to build a strong department and recruited a number of faculty members, including Drs. Moselio Schaechter, H. Vasken Aposhian, Edward Goldberg, Andrew Wright, and Abraham L. Sonnenshein - each of whom possessed an outstanding background and productive record.</p>
							<p>In 1968 the name of the department was changed from "microbiology" to "molecular biology and microbiology." That year Dr. Victor Najjar was recruited to direct an independent section on protein chemistry and to hold the first American Cancer Society (Massachusetts division) Chair in Molecular Biology at Tufts. When Dr. Najjar achieved emeritus status he was succeeded by Dr. John Coffin. That year Dr. Ralph Isberg, a Harvard Medical School graduate and a subsequent National Science Foundation/Presidential Young Investigator, joined the faculty. He has since become an assistant investigator at Tufts for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Park stepped down in 1970 in order to spend more time on his research, Dr. Moselio Schaechter, who holds a Ph. D. in microbiology from the University of Pennsylvania, was named professor and chair; he has continued to lead the department for the past twenty-three years. Dr. Schaechter has been named a Distinguished Professor at Tufts in recognition of his many accomplishments. He has also served as president of the American Society of Microbiology and of the Association of Medical School Microbiology Chairs.</p>
							<p>The Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology has excelled in its mission to provide students with quality instruction. Its graduate program, which was launched in 1965, has produced sixty-four Ph. D.'s and thirty-six predoctoral graduates. These graduates have gone on to hold training positions in the world's finest research institutions and have been unusually successful in establishing their own research groups. </p>
							<p>The department's faculty are well-known for their work and have been asked to present countless lectures and seminars all over the world. All of its members serve on editorial review boards for prestigious journals; many hold memberships in distinguished national committees and NIH study sections. Each has an extensive list of publications.</p>
							<p>Faculty have made important discoveries concerning the regulation of gene expression; cell and chromosome division in bacteria; bacterial differentiation; the mode of action of antibiotics; the dispersal of bacteria in natural environments; the mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis; bacteriophage genetics and replication; retrovirus replication and evolution; and gene expression in higher cells. </p>

							<head>Department of Neurology, 1893</head>
							<p> The medical school has offered courses in neurology since 1893 when Dr. Samuel Webber lectured twice a week on mental illness and diseases of the nervous system; the following year he was made the first professor of neurology. At that time neurology resembled psychiatry, and few neurology departments existed in the United States. School lectures focused on such topics as "the feebleminded," abnormal personalities, and drug and alcohol addiction.</p>
							<p>In 1902 Dr. Morton Prince became professor of neurology and chief at the Boston City Hospital. An accomplished physician and researcher, he was the author of several books, including Dissociation of the Personality (1902) and The Unconscious (1913). He also founded the Journal of Abnormal Psychology and served as its editor for twenty-three years. In 1910 he was appointed president of the American Neurological Association.</p>
							<p>In 1922 Dr. Abraham Myerson became the third professor of neurology. Although he was initially based at the Boston City Hospital, he later transferred to the Boston State Hospital, where he founded a division of research. During his tenure, the teaching of neurology changed dramatically at the medical school due to the opening of the Pratt Diagnostic Clinic in 1938. The major focus became medical illnesses - such as stroke, epilepsy, neuromuscular disease, and brain tumors - and their effects on the nervous system. At this time neurology began to resemble its present discipline.</p>
							<p>Until 1955 neurology at the New England Medical Center was managed by consultants whose primary appointments were in the Harvard Neurological Unit at the Boston City Hospital. That year, however, Dr. John E Sullivan, a general practitioner who had been trained in neurology in the Harvard Neurological Unit, joined the New England Medical Center and rose to the rank of professor and chairman of neurology at the medical school. He gradually built the first full-time department of neurology at both the New England Medical Center and at Tufts. The faculty he recruited included Drs. C. Wesley Watson, Huntington Porter, Thomas Twitchell, John Hills, Daniel Drachman, Elliott Marcus, and Ed Rabe.</p>
							<p>Dr. Sullivan was a charismatic teacher and clinician; a mentor for students, residents, and faculty; and an important force in American neurology during the third quarter of the twentieth century. He was successful in creating a productive department at both the school and the medical center. He retired as chairman in 1976 but continued to see patients and provide guidance to students and junior colleagues for an additional eight years.</p>
							<p>In 1977 Dr. Theodore Munsat was named head of the department. Dr. Munsat had held an appointment at the University of Southern California, where his work on neuromuscular disease had attracted notice. At Tufts he recruited Drs. Walter Bradley, John Growdon, Bruce Erhenberg, and Michael Pessin. Drs. Munsat, Bradley, and Lester Adelman, a neuropathologist at the school, went on to create a neuromuscular unit that became known world-wide. In 1982 Dr. Munsat stepped down as chairman in order to devote more time to research. He later became president of the American Academy of Neurology.</p>
							<p>Dr. Thomas Twitchell served as interim chair until Dr. Louis Caplan, the current chair of the department, was recruited in 1984. Dr. Caplan, who graduated from the University of Maryland's medical school and trained at the Boston City and Massachusetts General Hospitals, had been chief of neurology at the Beth Israel Hospital and a professor at the University of Chicago. Throughout his career he has held leadership positions in a number of national societies and committees and has served on many editorial boards. As chairman, Dr. Caplan continued the work of developing both the stroke unit and the neuromuscular division at the New England Medical Center and introduced epilepsy, neurophysiology, and neuro-oncology sections. The pediatric neurology division was greatly enhanced by his recruitment of Dr. N. Paul Rossman from Boston University. The program was also strengthened by the recruitment of Dr. Alan Ropper, acting chief of neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and a pioneer in neurological intensive care, to St. Elizabeth's Hospital and of Dr. A. Bernard Pleet, a former neurologist at the San Diego Naval Hospital, to the Baystate Medical Center.</p>
							<p>Today the department focuses on the teaching of neurosciences, neuropathology, the core curriculum, and electives. It also directs an active research program. </p>

							<head>Department of Neuroscience, 1983</head>
							<p> The neuroscience program at the medical school was introduced in the early 1980s as a seminar series designed to bring together Tufts investigators possessing a common interest in research related to the nervous system. Among the first coordinators were Drs. Barbara Talamo, Suzanne RofflerTarlov, and Kathy Dunlap. A graduate program in neuroscience developed out of that seminar series in 1983. In 1987 a neuroscience center was organized with Dr. Talamo as the chair.</p>
							<p>Later that year the center was awarded a five-year Pew Foundation Grant. This grant, one of five presented by the foundation, has been used to apply basic science research to clinical problems: faculty members have investigated neurodegenerative diseases by studying the relationship of peripheral olfactory neurons to the central neurons in the brain. This project, which has been spearheaded by Dr. John Kauer, has resulted in the identification of a peripheral site in the nervous system that shows extensive neural degeneration and altered neuronal function in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
							<p>The center's faculty members have achieved national and international recognition, as can be seen in the multitude of lectures and symposia they are invited to present each year. The senior faculty have served as members of NIH study sections and have participated in program project and center grant reviews at the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Neurosurgery, 1951" id="D00024">
							<head>Department of Neurosurgery, 1951</head>
							<p> Neurosurgery has been a division of surgery at the medical school since it first became a specialty in the 1920s; however, the school did not offer academic courses or student teaching until the Farnsworth surgical building opened at the New England Medical Center in 1949. Dr. William Sweet served as a consultant to the medical school and the New England Medical Center from 1948 until 1951, when he was named chief of neurosurgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He established a neurosurgical residency at Tufts in 1950.</p>
							<p>In 1951 Dr. Bertram Selverstone became the first full-time chair of the division at the school and chief neurosurgeon at the New England Medical Center. He went on to recruit a faculty that included Drs. Samuel Brendler, Robert Yuan, and John Drew, who later became responsible for developing a neurosurgery program at the Boston V.A. Medical Center. The bulk of the division's research and clinical effort during Dr. Selverstone's tenure was devoted to the localization of brain tumors with radio-isotopes and to the treatment of intracranial arterial aneurysms.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Selverstone left Boston in 1970, Dr. Bennett M. Stein, a former faculty member of the Neurological Institute at the Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, was named chair of the division. He brought with him Dr. Richard Fraser and William Shucart. In 1973 Dr. Fraser returned to New York, and Dr. R. Michael Scott replaced him as chief of pediatric neurosurgery. When Dr. Shucart left to become the neurosurgical chair of New York's Downstate Medical Center in 1975, Drs. Kalmon Post and Stephen Dell joined the faculty. Five years later Dr. Stein returned to New York to take on the chairmanship of the Department of Neurosurgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.</p>
							<p>In 1981 Dr. Shucart, the current head of the division, returned to Tufts to become chairman. Dr. Shucart, who received his M.D. degree from the University of Missouri and trained in neurosurgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, is presently a member of the American Board of Neurological Surgery, president of the New England Neurological Society, and secretary of the Society of Neuro-logical Surgeons. At Tufts he recruited Drs. David Kasdon, M'71, and Jack Stern. Dr. Joel Abromowitz later replaced Dr. Stern, and when Dr. Scott joined the staff of the Boston Children's Hospital, Dr. Alan Cohen became chief of pediatric neurosurgery. Dr. Kasdon died in 1988. The division now includes five neurosurgeons and four Ph. D. candidates involved in research.</p>
							<p>After Dr. Shucart took on the role of chairman, St. Elizabeth's Hospital and the Boston V.A. Medical Center both became an integral part of the program, and a research laboratory was established. Since 1983 this laboratory has been directed by Dr. John Kauer, who achieved international renown for his work on synaptic organization and olfaction. Dr. Julian Wu, another faculty member, has been studying the underlying genetic alterations in human brain tumors via molecular biological techniques, and Dr. Stephen Saris has been using animal models of primary brain tumors to investigate novel forms of therapy.</p>
							<p>Each faculty member participates in several teaching areas, including the neuroscience course for second-year students, the neurosurgical rotation for third-year students involved in the surgery clerkship, and the fourth-year elective. The clinical program has continued to thrive, and the residency program has attracted outstanding candidates. </p>

							<head>Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 1893</head>
							<p> During the school's first sixty years, obstetrics and gynecology were taught as separate disciplines, although one of the seven founders, Dr. John W. Johnson, was professor of both obstetrics and gynecology from 1893 to 1894. Dr. Johnson continued as a professor and chair of obstetrics until 1896, when he was succeeded by Dr. George H. Washburn (1897-1912).</p>
							<p>In 1893 obstetrics was taught via lectures and demonstrations with mannequins. However, by the turn of the century, students were obliged to attend two actual deliveries because of a change in Massachusetts licensure requirements. These were usually observed at either the Suffolk Dispensary, the Tremont Dispensary, or the Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
							<p>By 1913 it had become apparent to Dr. Leo Friedman, then chairman of the obstetrics department, that the school would have to begin teaching obstetrics in cooperation with hospitals. The first such arrangement was made in 1920 with the Evangeline Booth Hospital after the school had agreed to assume the responsibility for the obstetrical staffing and care there. In 1926 the Boston City Hospital agreed to a similar arrangement.</p>
							<p>That year Dr. Alonzo Paine was named professor and chair of obstetrics; he went on to serve in that capacity until 1948. Dr. Frederick J. Lynch was then appointed chair of the department, which at that time provided lectures for third-year students while assigning fourth-year students to the obstetrical departments of the Evangeline Booth, Boston City, Cambridge City, Providence Lying-In, Waltham, and Worcester City Hospitals as well as the New England Hospital for Women and Children.</p>
							<p>The first chair of the gynecology department, Dr. Ernest W. Cushing, was appointed in 1894. He was succeeded by Drs. George W. Kaan (1915-1921); Stephen Rushmore (1922-1927); and Louis Phaneuf (1927-1953). In 1928 the department began to provide a clinical experience at the Beth Israel Hospital. The little research it conducted at this time was clinical in nature.</p>
							<p>In 1957 the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology were combined at Tufts in keeping with a trend among medical schools. Dr. George W. Mitchell, Jr., who had served as gynecologist-in-chief at the New England Medical Center since 1950, was appointed professor of obstetrics and gynecology and chairman of the combined department. Dr. Mitchell's primary objective was to build a clinical base adequate for the teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students. Thus, gynecological examination began to be taught to second-year students as part of physical diagnosis; a six-week clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology was established for third-year students; and electives were developed for fourth-year students. Clinical teaching took place at the Carney, Cambridge, Quincy City, St. Margaret's, St. Elizabeth's, Wesson Women's (Springfield), and Women and Infants' (Providence, Rhode Island) Hospitals as well as at the Maine Medical Center. In 1970 a residency training program in obstetrics and gynecology was established in conjunction with the New England Medical Center, St. Margaret's Hospital, and the Carney Hospital. The Cambridge Hospital began to participate in this program in 1974.</p>
							<p>Dr. Mitchell went on to designate subspecialty areas in oncology, maternal and fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology. He also organized a productive research program. When he retired in 1981, Dr. Robert Kennison became acting chair.</p>
							<p>In 1983 Dr. Stephen Curry was named professor and chairman of the department. Dr. Curry was successful in meeting his goal of providing a qual-ity education for students; he himself was awarded several student citations for the high caliber of his teaching. He also appointed additional faculty and strengthened the obstetrical program at St. Margaret's Hospital.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Curry accepted a position at the University of Connecticut in 1989, Dr. Kennison again became the acting chair. Two years later the current head of the department, Dr. Alan DeCherney, a graduate of Temple's medical school, who had trained at the University of Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, was appointed. Dr. DeCherney, a former director of Yale's reproductive endo-crinology division, has held leadership positions in the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Fertility Society, the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the Society of Reproductive Endocrinologists, and the International Society of Gynecological Endoscopy. Since coming to Tufts, he has been successful in reorganizing the programs at St. Margaret's Hospital and the New England Medical Center and in expanding the divisions of reproductive endocrinology and of maternal and fetal medicine. During his tenure, the teaching programs at the Cambridge Hospital and the Baystate Medical Center-which recently opened a new obstetrics-gynecology building - have been strengthened by the addition of new faculty; an obstetrical unit has been developed at the New England Medical Center; and a new St. Margaret's Hospital has been sched-uled to open on the St. Elizabeth's Hospital campus. Moreover, the department has developed a strong research base in gynecological endocrinology and fertility, and faculty productivity has steadily increased with regard to grants and publications. Perhaps most importantly, student interest in obstetrics-gynecology as a potential career has reached an all-time high. </p>

							<head>Department of Ophthamology, 1893</head>
							<p> Ophthalmology was first taught at the medical school in 1893 by Dr. John Tenney, a lecturer who was promoted to professor in 1894. The school possessed a separate department of ophthalmology until 1963, when it was made a division of surgery. Until 1968 all ophthalmology chairs were also engaged in private practice, so they served on only a part-time basis at Tufts.</p>
							<p>For years the ophthalmology curriculum included lectures and a clinical experience. From 1893 to 1896 this experience was provided at the Suffolk Dispensary; from 1986 to 1900 it took place at the Boston Dispensary; and from 1900 to 1933 it was supplied by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. In the latter year teaching began at the Boston City Hospital.</p>
							<p>In 1968 Dr. Bernard Schwartz became the first full-time professor and chair of the school's Division of Ophthalmology and chief of ophthalmology at the New England Medical Center. He subsequently recruited faculty, reorganized the teaching program, established residency and fellowship programs, and developed a research enterprise. During his tenure, ophthalmology became a separate department again. Students were taught at the New England Medical Center and the Boston V.A. Medical Center, while residents rotated between the New England Medical Center, the Boston V.A. Medical Center, and the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester.</p>
							<p>Under Dr. Schwartz's leadership, the department developed both a full-time and part-time faculty for teaching, clinical care, and research. The faculty distinguished itself through its numerous publications, its participation in both national and international conferences, and its service on national commit-tees, such as those of the Association of Research in Vision Ophthalmology, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, and the National Institutes of Health.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Schwartz stepped down as chairman in 1990, Dr. Thomas R. Hedges, M1975, served as acting chair until Dr. Carmen Puliafito, a former faculty member of Harvard Medical School, was named head of the department in 1991. Dr. Puliafito graduated from Harvard Medical School and trained at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, has been editor-in-chief of Lasers and Surgery in Medicine, chairman of the Gordon Conference on Lasers in Medicine and Biology, and an examiner of the American Board of Ophthalmology. He has authored many publications pertaining to his field and currently serves on the editorial boards of several journals. At Tufts he has been devoted not only to the teaching of students and residents, but also to the continuing education of practicing ophthalmologists for whom he has organized many courses. </p>

							<head>Department of Orthopedic Surgery, 1906</head>
							<p> Although Dr. William Chipman, a professor of surgery, taught students about fractures and dislocations during the school's first few years, orthopedic surgery was first taught by Dr. Charles E. Painter in 1897. At that time the teaching of this discipline consisted of lectures and a clinical exposure for fourth-year students at the Boston Dispensary.</p>
							<p>Dr. Painter was appointed the first professor and chair of this division in 1906; he also served as chief of orthopedic surgery at the Carney Hospital. During his tenure, the Massachusetts General Hospital (1913) and the Carney Hospital (1914) began to participate in the program.</p>
							<p>Teaching was concentrated at the Massachusetts General Hospital while Dr. Mark Rogers was chairman - from 1925 to 1940 - although students were also exposed to orthopedic patients at both the Boston City and Beth Israel Hospitals. In 1949 St. Elizabeth's Hospital began to provide student teaching; however, after 1952 student teaching was concentrated primarily at the Boston City Hospital, since Drs. Russell Sullivan (1941-1954) and Alexander Aitken (1954-1965), Dr. Rogers' successors, held appointments there.</p>
							<p>Dr. Arthur Thibodeau, an expert on the management of spine problems who was chair of the division from 1965 to 1970, introduced an orthopedic residency at both the New England Medical Center and the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center. He was also responsible for training generations of clinically oriented orthopedic surgeons.</p>
							<p>After Dr. Henry H. Banks, M1945, was named chairman in 1970, he initiated a reorganization of the division. During his tenure, a full-time faculty was recruited with a practice plan based at the medical school, and departmental status was given to orthopedic surgery. Space for offices and ambulatory patient care was obtained at the New England Medical Center, where strong divisions of pediatric orthopedics, hand surgery, and joint replacement were developed. Research laboratories were established as were a fellowship (with funds provided by Dr. Carl Berg, M1931); an annual visiting professorship; the Arthur Thibodeau Lectureship; and a fully endowed chair. The department achieved recognition for its courses and publications and participated in the education of medical students at all levels; it also went on to develop the state's largest joint replacement program in cooperation with the New England Medical Center, the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center, and the New England Baptist Hospital.</p>
							<p>In 1983 Dr. Banks became dean of the medical school, and in 1984 Dr. Seymour Zimber, who had been vice chairman of the department, became the acting chair. Three years later the present head of the department, Dr. Michael Goldberg, was appointed chairman as well as the first Henry H. Banks Professor. Dr. Goldberg, who graduated from the State University of New York in Brooklyn and trained in orthopedic surgery in the Harvard program, holds leadership positions in the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, the Pediatric Society of North America, and the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine. Under his leadership, the faculty has been reorganized, the research program has been rejuvenated, and the department has maintained affiliations with the New England Medical Center, the Boston V.A. Medical Center, the New England Baptist Hospital, the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. The program now provides its residents with didactic courses in pathology, anatomy, and prosthetics and a combined curriculum with residents at the Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>
							<p>Today the residency is a five-year program with the first year in surgery taken at the New England Medical Center. There is a required research rotation. With limitations on hospital admissions and shorter lengths of stay, there has been a corresponding shift of the educational assignment of residents to outpatient areas in a preceptorship-type arrangement. </p>

							<head>Department of Otolaryngology, 1895</head>
							<p> In the late nineteenth century, otolaryngology was not taught as a combined specialty as it is today. Otologists, who were specialists in diseases of the ear, also treated nose and throat diseases. Laryngologists focused on the throat but often found themselves invading the field of otology. At this time there were few institutions in America devoted to the treatment of diseases of the ear, nose, and throat; the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary was one of the few major centers of otolaryngology. Residencies and internships were not available, so most specialists were forced to seek training overseas.</p>
							<p>In 1893 senior students at the medical school were required to attend an hour of instruction each week in diseases of the eye and ear. They were also obliged to receive an hour of practical instruction in diseases of the nose and throat via lectures and clinics. In 1895 Frederick L. Jack, who was then chairman of the otology department, began teaching students at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. He was succeeded by Dr. Edward Plummer (1903-1924) and Dr. Harry Cahill (1924-1929), the nation's first neuro-otologist.</p>
							<p>In 1895 Dr. William S. Boardman began teaching larnygology at the Boston Dispensary. Ten years later Dr. William E. Chenery, who was chief of laryngology at the Boston Dispensary, was appointed the first chair of that department at the medical school; he served in this capacity until 1929, when otology and laryngology were joined to become a single division. Dr. Harry Inglis was named professor and chair of the new department and chief of otolaryngology at the Boston Dispensary. In 1937 he was succeeded by Dr. Philip Meltzer, M1918, who had trained at the Eye and Ear Infirmary and who was in turn succeeded by Dr. J. Charles Drooker, M1933. He led the department from 1945 to 1968. During these years Tufts students were taught otolaryngology at the Boston City Hospital, the Boston Dispensary, the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, and the Beth Israel Hospital. Courses for third-year students stressed the examination of patients and the treatment of common ear, nose, and throat ailments.</p>
							<p>In 1968 Dr. Werner Chasin, was named the first full-time professor and chair of otolaryngology as well as the chief of that division at the New England Medical Center; he subsequently restructured the division to include full-time faculty at both the Boston City Hospital and the New England Medical Center. The residency program, which had been freestanding at the Boston City Hospital, began to involve the New England Medical Center as well. When Tufts withdrew from the Boston City Hospital in 1974, a joint otolaryngology residency program was established with Boston University.</p>
							<p>Today, the department is primarily involved in patient care, clinical research, and teaching activities. First-year students now take a class on the inner ear as part of their neuroscience course, while second-year students are taught the examination of the ear, nose, and throat. Third-year students spend one week on the otolaryngology service at one of Tufts' teaching hospitals, and fourth-year students may choose from a number of electives.</p>
							<p>Many alumni have achieved distinction as leaders in the field of otolaryngology, including Drs. Meltzer, M1918, Drooker, M1933, and Chasm, M1958, and Drs. Richard Fabian, M1966, Floyd Goffin, M1956, Daniel Miller M1939, Alan Nahum, M1957, Robert Ossof, M1975, and Elliot Strong, M1956. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Pathology, 1893" id="D00029">
							<head>Department of Pathology, 1893</head>
							<p> Beginning in 1893 pathology was taught at the medical school through lectures and laboratories. Henry W. Dudley was named the first professor and chair of the department and served in that capacity until 1900. That year Dr. Timothy Leary was appointed chairman; he went on to serve for twenty-nine years. During this period he brought prestige to the department through the quality of his teaching and his development of a testing laboratory; this reputation in turn helped attract increased numbers of applicants and much-needed income.</p>
							<p>After Dr. Leary retired, interim leadership was provided by Drs. Tracy B. Mallory (1929-1930); Harold MacMahon (1930-1931); and Sidney C. Dalrymple (1931-1933). In 1933 Dr. MacMahon was appointed the first full-time chair and professor of pathology. He subsequently became responsible for teaching both pathology and bacteriology to medical and dental students and for organizing the development of the department. In order to raise funds for this purpose, he made arrangements to provide pathology services to many of the community hospitals in the greater Boston area in exchange for a fee. These funds were then deposited with the college for use by the department. Dr. MacMahon later became successful in recruiting additional faculty, which allowed him to focus on the teaching of pathology. He remained a devoted and highly respected teacher throughout his thirty-eight-year tenure.</p>
							<p>When Dr. MacMahon retired in 1970, Dr. Martin Flax, a former member of the faculty at Harvard Medical School who holds a Ph. D. from Columbia University, an M.D. from the University of Chicago, and an M.S. in health management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was named professor and chair. He also became chief at the New England Medical Center. Under his aegis, additional faculty have been recruited, the department has been renovated and equipped with modern instruments, a graduate program has been instituted, and the residency has been reorganized. Dr. Flax has also supervised the development of a major departmental research program. Originally, immunology and cancer biology research received major emphasis; however, in recent years the program has focused on research involving molecular biology and eukaryotic genetics. The department has been very successful in obtaining research support - it now receives over $3.5 million - and has achieved both a national and international reputation for its work.</p>
							<p>Since 1970, when the school introduced "systems" teaching to the curriculum, the pathology department has sponsored a general course for first-year students as well as a component that is incorporated into each of the "systems" courses for second-year students. The department is well known for the quality of its teaching, and members of the faculty have been the recipients of many "excellence in teaching" awards given by graduating classes. The graduate program has also been successful and has attracted increasing numbers of applicants over the years. </p>

							<head>Department of Pediatrics, 1930</head>
							<p> Pediatrics has been taught at the medical school since 1893, when Dr. William A. White provided instruction in childhood diseases. In 1894 Dr. Harold Williams became the first professor of pediatrics. He served through 1899, making use of the pediatric clinics at the Boston Dispensary for student education. Drs. Edmund C. Stowell (1900-1911) and Dr. William R.P. Emerson (1911-1929), his successors, also taught students at the Boston Dispensary. Teaching during this early period was accomplished through didactic lectures and class demonstrations as well as clinics.</p>
							<p>In 1930 Dr. Elmer W. Barton became the first head of the newly established Department of Pediatrics when he was appointed professor of pediatrics at the school, physician-in-chief at the Boston Floating Hospital, and chief at the Boston Dispensary's children's clinic. His successor, Dr. James M. Baty, was professor and chairman from 1942 to 1965. During his tenure, the teaching of pediatrics continued to be provided primarily to third- and fourth-year students. In the third year students were exposed to sixty-four hours of lectures as well as clinical demonstrations. They were also assigned to the clinics of the Boston Dispensary and the Boston Floating Hospital for a month. Dr. Baty extended the fourth-year clerkship to include the Charles V. Chapin (Providence, Rhode Island); Malden; and Booth Memorial Hospitals. During these years the department's research was primarily clinically oriented, except for the work of Dr. Richard Wagner, who studied glycogen metabolism in children.</p>
							<p>With the arrival of Dr. Sydney S. Gellis, an internationally respected pediatrician, in 1965, a full-time department of pediatrics was established. Under his leadership, the department remained clinically strong and con-tinued to provide an excellent education for students. It also began to develop research programs that focused on the value of the growth hormone for childrenwith hypopituitarism, seizure control, the link between birth defects and chromosomal abnormalities, hepatitis, autism, and jaundice of the newborn. The program was strengthened in the Boston Floating Hospital division of the New England Medical Center as well, for its family participation unit was expanded and improved; a March of Dimes-supported birth defect center was established; divisions of neurology, infectious disease, and urology were introduced, adolescent and intensive care units were developed; and a pediatric trauma center was organized.</p>
							<p>Dr. Gellis achieved emeritus status in 1979 and was succeeded by Dr. Richard C. Talamo. When Dr. Talamo's term was cut short by illness in 1981, Dr. Marshall Kreidberg became acting chairman. In 1983 Dr. Jane Schaller was appointed professor and chair of the school and pediatrician-in-chief at the Boston Floating Hospital. Dr. Schaller, who holds an M.D. degree from Harvard Medical School, and trained at the University of Washington in Seattle, is an eminent pediatrician who has achieved national recognition for her work on arthritis in children. As chair of pediatrics she strengthened and expanded the department's clinical, academic, and research activities. She also added new divisions in nephtology, rheumatology, and critical care and has restructured those of general pediatrics, pulmonology, gastroenterology/nutrition, cardiology, neonatology, hematology/oncology, infectious disease, and neurology. Under her aegis, an outstanding residency program has been developed, forty-nine new faculty have been appointed, and a number of innovative programs have been instituted, (including the Boston Perinatal Center, the Affiliated Children's Arthritis Center of New England, the Failure to Thrive Clinic, the Center for Children with Special Needs, the Children's Cancer Center, and the International Adoption Clinic). In 1992 the department ranked second among the school's clinical departments in terms of research activity. Research funding has grown from approximately $600,000 (in 1984) to over $3.5 million.</p>
							<p>Under Dr. Schaller's leadership the Department of Pediatrics developed a truly distinguished faculty, many of whom are acknowledged as national leaders in their field. They have published extensively in pediatric and basic science journals and have served on the editorial boards of prestigiousjournals. Faculty members have been elected to the American Pediatric Society and the Society for Pediatric Research. Their 1992 honors include the Humanitarian of the Year Award of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America (Dr. Richard Grand) and the Amelia Earhart Award of the Women's Educational Industrial Union (Dr. Schaller). Dr. Schaller was also elected to the Institute of Medicine. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Pharmacology, 1915" id="D00031">
							<head>Department of Pharmacology, 1915</head>
							<p> The medical school's 1893 course listing described pharmacology - or "materia medica and therapeutics" as it was called at the time - as consisting of "didactic lectures and recitations with practice in writing prescriptions." This course was presented to second-year students by Dr. Frank Wheatley, who became the first chair of the newly named Department of Pharmacology in 1915.</p>
							<p>Dr. Wheatley was succeeded by Drs. Frank E. Haskins (1922 -1936); James C. Healy (1936-1948), and Byron B. Clark (1956-1958). In 1958 Dr. Morris Friedkin was appointed chairman; he later became successful in developing a modern department of pharmacology, recruiting a number of new faculty members, and establishing a strong research program that focused on biochemical pharmacology.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Friedkin became the chair of the biochemistry department in 1967, most members of his department accepted positions as biochemists, which necessitated the reconstitution of the Department of Pharmacology. It became difficult to find a new chair of pharmacology, and this situation was further complicated by Dr. Friedkin's departure from Tufts in 1968. The search for leadership of the two departments was unproductive, and after much thought it was decided to combine them. In 1969 Dr. Henry Mautner was appointed to chair the combined department, which taught both biochemistry and pharmacology. After he retired in 1984, Dr. David Stollar became the acting chair. Two years later the departments were made separate again. Dr. Stollar was named chairman of biochemistry and Dr. Louis Shuster was appointed acting chair of pharmacology. Drs. Thomas W. North and Theoharis Theoharides joined him as a nucleus for a future Department of Pharmacology.</p>
							<p>In 1991 Dr. Richard I. Shader, an internationally known psychopharmacologist who had previously been head of Tufts' Department of Psychiatry, was appointed professor and chairman of the newly named Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Dr. Shader, who received his M.D. degree from New York University and trained at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the NIH, has served as president of both the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology. He served as editor-in-chief of the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology. Under his leadership, a number of outstanding faculty have been recruited to the department and a psychopharmacology unit has been established. The department has also made progress toward its goal of furthering the understanding of the effects of drugs and toxic substances on the cellular and molecular make-up of humans and animals. In the past year the department's faculty have received a variety of honors: Dr. David J. Greenblatt has been cited for being among the world's twenty most frequently published authors in refereed scientific journals; Dr. Lawrence G. Miller has been named the recipient of the American Society of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics' Leon Goldberg Young Investigator Award; and Dr. Theoharides has been selected to receive an "excellence in teaching" citation by the graduating class. </p>

							<head>Department of Physics and Astronomy, 1854</head>
							<p> As early as the first year of instruction at Tufts College (1854-55), physics was a required field of study in the four year curriculum, with students beginning study of the during the second half of their sophomore year. Under the heading of physics, courses in astronomy were also taught during this period. Prior to the 1891-92 academic year, no departments were designated, other than the Department of Engineering, however, physics is among the first liberal arts departments listed in the catalogue in 1891.</p>
							<p>There has never been an autonomous Department of Astronomy. A major in the field was offered from 1966-1973, under the supervision of the Department of Mathematics. Following the shift from a major to an astronomy plan of study in 1973, astronomy courses fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Physics. The department's name changed to Department of Physics and Astronomy in 1987. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Physiology, 1893" id="D00033">
							<head>Department of Physiology, 1893</head>
							<p> Physiology was first taught at the medical school in 1893 as a lecture course. (The first professor of physiology was Dr. Albert Nott, who was also the first dean of the medical school.) By 1900 laboratory sessions were provided, and by 1929 first-year students were required to devote five afternoons a week to the subject.</p>
							<p>That year Dr. David Rapport was recruited to teach medical and dental students and develop research. Stressing the importance of laboratory sessions, he conducted a series of experiments on dogs, in which groups of students were asked to prove series of points about the circulatory and respiratory systems.</p>
							<p>In those years the department's research focused on several areas: the chemical process involved in vision; the enzymatic reactions involved in amino acid, protein, nucleic acid, and nucleoprotein metabolism; and the utilization of phosphate bond energy in the synthesis of protein from amino acids. The Charlton Fund helped support this research as well as laboratory fellowships.</p>
							<p>In the 1960s and 1970s the department underwent a series of changes under the leadership of Dr. Walter L. Hughes. He believed that laboratory experimentation should demonstrate the principles of physiology via modern techniques. As such, he ensured that the laboratory was equipped with electronic transducers and recorders that would permit students to make sophisticated and precise measurements. He also expanded the graduate program to include Ph. D. candidates and postdoctoral investigators. Departmental research at this time focused largely on cellular mechanisms involving macro molecules (proteins and nucleic acids). When Dr. Hughes stepped down as chair in 1977, the department was subsequently led for two years by Dr. Jeffrey Sharpe and for four years by Dr. Eunice Bloomquist (in an acting role).</p>
							<p>Dr. Irwin M. Arias became professor and chairman in 1984. He received his M.D. degree from SUNY in Brooklyn and trained in medicine at the Boston City Hospital and at Albert Einstein's in New York. He became a distinguished professor of medicine at Einstein before coming to Tufts. Arias has proved to be a superb investigator, teacher, and administrator, creating a first-rate Department of Physiology, attracting outstanding faculty, and developing an impressive research program. Under his leadership, a totally new physiology laboratory was built and equipped with modern equipment. Moreover, the department has grown to such an extent that it now includes fourteen full-time faculty, forty postdoctoral fellows, twenty-eight graduate students, eight M.D. /Ph. D. students, and five physician scientists. As of this date each faculty member has been awarded at least one NIH grant; the total departmental research support exceeds $5 million. The faculty have also received an NIH training grant as well as nineteen major awards from various sources, such as the Rockefeller, Markey, Macy, and Pew Foundations. Drs. Arias and Dice have been honored with the prestigious NIH MERIT Award.</p>
							<p>In the last two decades classic organ physiology has moved from basic science departments into clinical settings: cardiac catheterization, pulmonary function assessment, and intestinal motility have become critical in patient management and are rarely the subject of modern physiology laboratories. In addition, physiology departments have shifted their focus to cellular and molecular physiology: Tufts' department is currently researching how events on the surface of cells regulate gene expression - namely how hormones and growth factors interact with their receptors and how cells respond by growth, differentiation, or transformation.</p>
							<p>The physiology department in 1999 presents a basic course in medical physiology for first-year students: modern principles of normal physiology are considered in lectures, patient presentations, small group discussions, and problem-solving exercises. Second-year students take parhophysiology among other subjects. No laboratory sessions are currently offered. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Psychiatry, 1928" id="D00034">
							<head>Department of Psychiatry, 1928</head>
							<p> Tufts appointed Dr. Walter Channing its first professor of "mental diseases" - the predecessor of psychiatry - in 1894; he held this appointment until 1902. Students at that time took a course consisting of twelve lectures and a clinical study of patients at the Boston Insane Hospital (later renamed the Boston State Hospital), the Boston Dispensary, and the Massachusetts School for the Feebleminded. By the turn of the century, senior students were attending weekly lectures in "normal medical psychology"; they also received some grounding in psychology and psychiatry from Dr. Morton Prince, the professor of neurology from 1902 to 1912.</p>
							<p>Dr. Prince was succeeded by Dr. Edward Lane (1912-1928) and Dr. Douglas Thom, who was appointed Tufts' professor of psychiatry in 1928. With the help of Dean A. Warren Stearns, Dr. Thom organized a teaching program to provide instruction in psychiatry to second-, third-, and fourth-year students. Beginning in 1931 each senior student was required to complete a one-month clerkship in a state hospital.</p>
							<p>Dr. Jackson Thomas succeeded Dr. Thom in 1947 and subsequently revised the curriculum so that second-year students would receive sixteen hours of lectures and demonstrations; third-year students would attend five two-hour training sessions in the clinics of the Boston Dispensary, the Beth Israel Hospital, and the Boston Psychopathic Hospital; and fourth-year stu-dents would serve a month as psychiatric clinical clerks at one of the school's affiliated hospitals. Despite these changes, the department continued to lack full-time teachers and a research program at the time of Dr. Thomas' retirement in 1963.</p>
							<p>However, that year Dr. Paul G. Myerson,a well-known psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, became the department's first full-time professor and chairman. He went on to institute three series of didactic lectures: the first-year course concentrated on normal development; the second-year course dealt with concepts related to psychoneuroses, psychosomatic illnesses, and character problems; and the third-year course focused on the understanding and management of psychoses. Senior students continued to serve a rotation in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
							<p>Under Dr. Myerson's leadership, the department distinguished itself through its commitment to psychodynamically and psychoanalytically oriented therapies, which were integrated into its community psychiatry activities and its work with families. During this time, a number of the department's faculty members held staff positions at the New England Medical Center, where they launched an inpatient program for the treatment of young adults suffering from psychoses and borderline mental illness. The department also performed extensive outreach work with its neighborhing communities, especially Chinatown, North Dorchester, and South Boston. In order to accomplish its teaching missions it developed a strong relationship with the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health as well as affiliations with the Boston V.A. Medical Center, the Faulkner Hospital, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, and the Baystate Medical Center.</p>
							<p>When Dr. Myerson stepped down as chairman in 1979, Dr. Richard I. Shader was recruited to lead the department. While the departmental base remained at the New England Medical Center, certain goals were established for maintaining and augmenting the department's strengths. One of these goals was to develop psychiatry's role within the realm of classical medicine. The department's teaching emphasis was subsequently shifted from a psycho-social and cultural perspective to a more comprehensive biopsychosocial approach. In addition, the third-year clinic began to be offered only in general hospital settings possessing readily available consultative services from other medical disciplines.</p>
							<p>Among Dr. Shader's earliest appointments was Dr. Carol Nadelson as director of residency training and vice chair of academic affairs. A nationally known educator, she became the first woman to be elected president of the American Psychiatric Association. Another major recruitment was that of Dr. David J. Greenblatt, an internist and clinical pharmacologist with an interest in pharmacokinetics and geriatric pharmacology. Dr. Greenblatt became involved in the development of a Division of Clinical Pharmacology to be housed jointly in the Departments of Psychiatry and Medicine.</p>
							<p>During Dr. Shader's tenure, the department received continuous federal research support. Dr. Shader himself became the recipient of an NIH MERIT Award. While the department's training and research efforts were successful, it also continued its tradition of clinical service by establishing progams for the treatment of sexually abused children and substance abusers as well as a joint training enterprise with the Department of Pediatrics. These achievements have won the department widespread recognition.</p>
							<p>In 1991 Dr. Shader stepped down as chairman of psychiatry and became professor and chair of the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Dr. Arthur Z. Mutter, a faculty member since 1969, served as acting chair until Dr. Marshal E Folstein was chosen as professor and chair in 1992. A graduate of Georgetown, he trained in Indiana, Cleveland, and New York City. He has been director of Johns Hopkins Hospital psychiatry division. </p>

							<head>Department of Radiation Oncology, 1968</head>
							<p> Dr. Robert Paul was largely responsible for the creation of a Department of Radiation Oncology at Tufts. As a newly appointed chairman of the radiology department, he called for the establishment of a separate division of radiation oncology-or "therapeutic radiology," as it was called at the time. Thus, in 1968 Dr. Fernando Bloedorn was charged with this responsibility and subsequently established the first department of its kind to exist in any American medical school.</p>
							<p>The new department was divided into clinical, physics, and radiobiology divisions; Dr. Bloedorn later organized multidisciplinary clinics involving other specialties. He was able to develop a strong department, which eventually received referrals from many hospitals in the greater Boston area; he also introduced a residency program. After he died in 1975, the department was able to continue flourishing because he had trained a number of adept radiation oncologists. Drs. S. J. Munzenreider and Anthony Piro provided leadership in the interim period.</p>
							<p>In 1980 Dr. Hywel Madoc-Jones, who holds a master's degree from Oxford University, a Ph. D. from the University of London, and an M.D. degree from the University of Chicago, was appointed chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. Dr. Madoc-Jones has served as president of both the Massachusetts Radiological Society and the New England Society of Radiation Oncology, as a counselor to the American College of Radiology, and as a member of the board of directors of the American Society of Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology. Under his aegis, the department has been strengthened in terms of its physical needs, staffing, and residency program. The department's electives have recently been attracting increasing numbers of students, and the quality of its teaching program has been widely recognized. The department's radiobiology division has been highly productive in basic science research under the leadership of Drs. Donald Wallach, Rupert Schmidt-Ullrich, and Carmia Borek. </p>

							<head>Department of Radiology, 1915</head>
							<p> Tufts' medical school was the first in the country to include radiology in its curriculum. In 1915 Dr. Ariel W. George, M1906, first organized the radiology department, which at the rime provided students with thirty hours of lectures. Dr. Frederick O'Brien, an internationally recognized specialist in radiation therapy, succeeded Dr. George in 1922. In 1941 he in turn was succeeded by Dr. Samuel Robins, M1914, who expanded the teaching program into a one-month elective course.</p>
							<p>Dr. Alice Ettinger, who had been responsible for establishing a radiology residency at the New England Medical Center in 1945, became chair of the department in 1959. A highly skilled radiologist and professor, she was honored with numerous teaching awards by her students. In 1966 Dr. Ettinger was succeeded by Dr. Robert Paul, a graduate of the Baylor University School of Medicine and a Tufts faculty member since 1957. Dr. Paul, the school's current chair, is also chief of radiology at the New England Medical Center. Under his leadership, the department has developed broad-based diagnostic services using the latest techniques and equipment. Its research has been primarily clinical.</p>
							<p>When clinical clerkships were moved from the fourth to the third year in 1959, radiology lectures were eliminated from the curriculum. However, the department has remained active in student teaching, and correlative sessions are provided to first- and second-year students. Members of the radiology faculty including Drs. Robert Sarno and Barbara Carter have been frequently honored by students for their teaching efforts. The department continues to be affiliated with hospitals possessing outstanding radiology divisions, including the Boston V.A. Medical Center, the New England Baptist Hospital, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the Lemuel Shattuck Hospital, the Faulkner Hospital, the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, and the Baystate Medical Center. </p>

							<head>Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, 1955</head>
							<p> The discipline of rehabilitation medicine developed as a result of the need to bring about the recovery of disabled members of the armed forces who had served during World War II. Rehabilitation medicine has been a part of the medical school curriculum since the early 1950s. In 1954 an inpatient rehabilitation unit was opened at the New England Medical Center. In 1955 the school received its first training grant from the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, which enabled it to establish a division of physical medicine and rehabilitation within the Department of Medicine. Dr. Heinrich G. Brugsch, who had been responsible for developing the Boston Dispensary's rehabilitation program, was its first chief, serving from 1955 to 1956. From 1956 to 1958 the department was led by Dr. Frederick Shepard, M1952, an alumnus who had received his rehabilitation training at the Rusk Institute in New York, and from 1958 to 1963 it was headed up by Dr. John Lorenz. During this period students received an exposure to rehabilitation medicine throughout all four years. In the mid-1960s a residency program was established at the New England Medical Center; this program became merged with that of the Boston V.A. Medical Center in 1973.</p>
							<p>During the last twenty-five years, the department has been led by several distinguished experts in rehabilitation medicine, including Drs. Harold Sterling, Frank Krusen, Carl Grainger, Paul Corcoran, Bruce Gans, Nancy Reisman Mann, and Marvin Brooke, the current chairman, who received his M.D. degree from Emory University and trained at the University of Washington in Seattle. Dr. Grainger, who served as chair from 1968 to 1977, and Dr. Glenn Gresham, who directed the research program, became pioneers in the scientific measurement of function in disabled persons and edited the first textbook of functional assessment in rehabilitation. Since that time rehabilitation engineering has produced new techniques for plastic orthotics and computerized nonvocal communication devices; electrodiagnostic procedures, including electromyography and nerve conduction tests, have been refined; and neuropsychological testing techniques for developmentally or traumatically brain-injured persons have been introduced.</p>
							<p>After the New England Medical Center's Rehabilitation Center discontinued its inpatient services in 1989, Tufts' department relocated its base to the New England Sinai Hospital and Rehabilitation Center in Stoughton, Massachusetts, where it now conducts the majority of its inpatient rehabilitation teaching activities. The deparment's other sites for training and instruction include the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center, the Greenery Rehabilitation and Skilled Nursing Center, the West Roxbury Veterans Administration Medical Center, the New England Rehabilitation Hospital, the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, and the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Today the department's curriculum includes correlative sessions for first- and second-year students, who are also required to serve part of a four-week rotation in rehabilitation medicine during their senior year.</p>
							<p>The Department of Rehabilitation Medicine has received numerous honors that testify to its position of national leadership in physical medicine and rehabilitation. It has also been awarded some of the first funds of the new NIH Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research. Faculty member Dr. Ryner M. Bloch has been appointed as a grant peer reviewer for the U.S. Department of Education Rehabilitation Services Administration; Marilyn Lash, M.S.W., has been named president of the National Association of Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers; and Dr. Harry C. Webster is currently serving as president of the New England Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Department of Surgery, 1893" id="D00038">
							<head>Department of Surgery, 1893</head>
							<p> Surgery was first taught at the medical school in 1893 by Dr. William R. Chipman, one of the school's seven founders, who sponsored a lecture course and demonstrations that included cadaver dissection and surgical operations. At the turn of the century surgery was also taught through clinics at the Boston Dispensary and the Boston City Hospital, where students were permitted to observe operations. By 1929 surgical lectures and clinics were offered to second- and third-year students, while senior students spent a month on surgery during the course of their rotations.</p>
							<p>Until 1949 the Department of Surgery was led by a part-time chair who was also a practicing surgeon. However, that year Dr. C. Stuart Welch, who was named professor and chairman of the department at Tufts and surgeon-in-chief at the New England Medical Center, began to develop the school's first full-time surgical department. He recruited new faculty in anesthesia, urology, neurosurgery, orthopedic surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and pediatric surgery and went on to establish a productive surgical research laboratory at the New England Medical Center's Ziskind Building. He also introduced a five-year surgical residency program in cooperation with the New England Medical Center, the Boston V.A. Medical Center, and the Boston City and Newton-Wellesley Hospitals.</p>
							<p>In 1952 Dr. Welch was succeeded by Dr. C. Gardiner Child, III, who set out to establish a true university teaching service that would include subsidized wards for the care of indigent patients. He was successful in organizing this service at the Boston City Hospital, where he also established a research laboratory. After Dr. Child stepped down in 1958, Dr. Ralph Deterling , Jr. became head of the department and continued the work of developing full-time faculty at the New England Medical Center, the Boston City Hospital, and the Boston V.A. Medical Center.</p>
							<p>After Dr. Deterling retired in 1974, Dr. Richard J. Cleveland, an inter-nationally recognized cardiovascular surgeon, was appointed professor and chairman at the school and surgeon-in-chief at the New England Medical Center. Dr. Cleveland, who received his M.D. degree and his postgraduate education at the Medical College of Virginia, has been responsible for instituting progressive improvements in the undergraduate teaching curriculum and for redefining the graduate training program in surgery and subspecialties. During his tenure, surgical research facilities have been enlarged and modernized at the New England Medical Center, and operating suites and intensive care facilities have become available at the new Boston Floating Hospital. Eight Tufts affiliated teaching hospitals - including the Baystate Medical Center, the Faulkner Hospital, the New England Medical Center, the Newton-Wellesley Hospital, St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the Boston V.A. Medical Center, and the Winchester Hospital - have been integrated into the overall teaching, training, and clinical activities of the department.</p>
							<p>During the last decade the number of full-time surgical faculty has doubled at the school. Members of the department have become increasingly productive in their contributions to surgical literature and publish about one hundred papers per year in major medical journals. The faculty have also held leadership positions in important commirtees and on surgical specialty boards and have been represented at national and international conferences. Dr. Cleveland has been chairman of the American Board of Thorasic Surgery and has served on the American Board of Surgery and on the residency review committees for general surgery and thoracic surgery, while Dr. Paul Friedmann has led the Surgery Residency Review Committee. Dr. Burton Harris was president of the International Society of Aeromedical Services, the Society for Pediatric Trauma, and the New England Pediatric Surgical Society.</p>

							<head>Department of Urban and Environmental Policy, 1973</head>
							<p> The Department of Urban and Environmental Policy, or UEP, was formed in 1973 as the Graduate Program in Urban, Social, and Environmental Policy. </p>
							<p>In 1972, Frank Colcord of the Department of Political Science commissioned Hermann Field, of the Tufts-New England Medical Center Planning Office, to conceptualize an interdisciplinary graduate program emphasizing environmental sustainability and grassroots activism. The aim of the program was to combine work in environment with work in urban planning in order to broaden the skills and knowledge of graduate students working in the field.</p>
							<p>The Program in Urban, Social, and Environmental Policy was granted trial status in 1973.The first class consisted of only nine students, and Field acted as the founding director. The faculty of the program included professors from the Departments of Political Science, Sociology, Economics, Biology, and Education. Three years later, in 1976, the Program in Urban, Social and Environmental Policy was formally accepted as a graduate program. Though it received little money from Tufts, the program had been awarded a total of $220,000 in federal grants by 1977. The program moved into the Brown House at 38 Professors Row in 1977.Construction on the new Campus Center, however, necessitated its relocation to 97 Talbot Avenue in 1983.The Program in Urban, Social and Environmental Policy established its first joint degree program with the Department of Civil Engineering in 1978.The following year, university trustees voted department status to the program, and its name was officially changed to the Department of Urban and Environmental Policy. Rob Hollister was named the first chair of UEP in January, 1980.</p>
							<p>During the fall of that same year, UEP announced the formation of the Program in Public Policy and Citizen Participation, or PPCP, which would be administered in conjunction with the Department of Political Science. The Center for Public Services was established in 1986 as an umbrella organization to oversee both the UEP and the PPCP. It was dissolved in 1989, however, when the UEP and the PPCP merged.</p>
							<p>UEP and the Fletcher School announced the formation of a three-year dual degree program in International Environmental Policy, the first of UEP's dual degree programs, in 1989.Three years later, UEP was ranked first in the country among urban masters programs, and was also leading the environmental and social track of the newly created undergraduate major in Environmental Studies. The same year, Hollister resigned as chair, and was replaced by Shelly Krimsky. </p>
							<p>UEP received its largest grant to date in 1994, when the Alvin Levin Fellowship was formed in order to provide funding for a UEP female graduate student of color. UEP also launched in that same year a joint degree with the Department of Economics. Additionally, the department began to work collaboratively with the School of Nutrition, a relationship that ultimately resulted in the establishment of a dual degree program administered by both the UEP and the School of Nutrition in 2000.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, UEP continues to operate out of 97 Talbot Avenue. It offers graduate degrees as well as certificates in Management of Community Organizations, Community Environmental Studies, and joint degrees with Economics, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Biology, and Child Development. </p>

							<head>Department of Urology, 1910</head>
							<p> Urology was first taught at Tufts in 1893 by Dr. J. Cushing Allison, who lectured to seniors. From 1895 to 1897 Dr. Fred S. Raddin instructed students in urology via lectures and demonstrations at the Boston Dispensary, and from the latter year until 1906 Dr. Gardiner W. Allen held this responsibility.</p>
							<p>The medical school established a department of urology in 1910; Dr. Charles M. Whitney, whose later bequest provided for the establishment of a chair in urology, was named head of the new department. He later was succeeded by Dr. Arthur L. Chute in 1931, Dr. Harold A. Chamberlin in 1933, and Dr. Wyland E. Leadbetter in 1947. Beginning in 1933 it became customary for the chair of this department to also serve as chief of urology at the New England Medical Center.</p>
							<p>In 1954 Dr. Burdick G. Clarke was appointed chairman: he subsequently initiated teaching programs at St. Elizabeth's Hospital, the Boston City Hospital, and the Boston Veterans Administration Medical Center. His successor, Dr. Henry M. Wise, was responsible for developing a special laboratory for the evaluation of patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction, while Dr. Alan B. Retik, who served as chair of the department from 1967 to 1969, was instrumental in creating a program in pediatric urology that brought the division international recognition. During the tenure of Dr. StephenA. Mahoney, who was chairman from 1969 to 1974, a renal transplantation program was instituted at the New England Medical Center. When he left Boston in 1974, Dr. Robert Spellman became acting chair until Dr. Edwin Meares, the current head of the department, was named chairman in 1975. Dr. Meares is a well-known specialist on infectious diseases of the genito-urinary tract who has served on a number of national and international committees. A graduate of the Medical College of South Carolina, he trained in urology at Stanford. In 1989 he was presented with the Hugh -Hempton Young Award in honor of his contributions to the field. As chair of Tufts' urology department, Dr. Meares has developed a strong academic program that focuses on student teaching, research, and patient care. He also serves as the school's Charles M. Whitney Professor of Urology as well as the New England Medical Center's urologist-in-chief. </p>

							<head>Dental Health Sciences Building, 1969</head>
							<p> Construction began on the Tufts Dental Health Sciences building at One Kneeland Street on the Boston campus in 1969, after four years of planning. The building, constructed to expand the facilities of the School of Dental Medicine, was finally dedicated in April, 1973.</p>
							<p>The eight-story building, originally slated to cost $12 million, actually cost the university a total of $14.5 million. Rising construction costs over the course of the building's completion caused the price increase, and at its dedication one and a half floors remained empty due to financial restrictions. </p>
							<p>Tufts began planning the project in 1965, after numerous requests for more space from dental school faculty and students. The dental school had been sharing a building with the School of Medicine, and was restricted to tight teaching and operative quarters. During the planning phases of the new building, Tufts received a $7.5 million grant from the federal government to assist in covering the construction costs. In March, 1970, Tufts received a second grant, from the New England Regional Commission. The grant of $500,000 was in recognition of Tufts continued contribution to New England area dentistry. During the summer of 1970, Tufts received one last grant, for $250,000, in order to build the Center for Diagnosis and Prognosis of Oral Diseases in the new building. </p>
							<p>The completed building contained modern operating rooms, new seminar rooms, faculty offices, lounge areas, a large lecture room, and classrooms. The building also contained larger clinic facilities and more space for graduate research. All of the clinics and operating rooms were decorated with artwork to make dental treatment a more pleasant experience for patients. </p>
							<p>As of 2001, the Dental Health Sciences Building continues to serve as the headquarters of the School of Dental Medicine. Its laboratory facilities have been updated to contain modern dental equipment. </p>

When Tufts voted to accept women into the student body in 1894, Dewick transferred from Susquehanna College Institute, in Towanda, Pennsylvania, being urged by her father to attend a college built on Universalist ideals. She graduated from Tufts in 1896 with a Woman of Arts degree and taught for several years.</p>
							<p>In 1920, Dewick was elected as the first woman to serve on the Board of Trustees, serving the institution for twenty years. She was also the first woman to serve on the visiting committee to Jackson College. Dewick advocated for the Tufts women students and worked for the building of Stratton Hall. </p>
							<p>She received an honorary Master of Arts and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Tufts. Dewick was also the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award, director and past president of the Association of Tufts Alumnae, president of the Universalist Women's Alliance and active in several other academic, women's and Universalists' organizations.

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02454"><head>Professor Amos Dolbear, ca. 1900</head></figure>Amos Emerson Dolbear (1837-1910), known to his students at Tufts as "Dolly," chaired the Department of Astronomy and Physics at the college beginning in 1874. He was a "theoretical scientist" who enjoyed the discovery of new possibilities, including his pioneering research concerning telephony.</p>
							<p>Dolbear was born in Norwich, Connecticut, on November 10, 1837.Following his father's death, he and his mother moved to Newport, Rhode Island, where he remained with his mother until her death in 1847.He then went to live on a relative's farm in New Hampshire and eventually was sent to Worcester, Massachusetts, to learn a trade. He was employed briefly by a pistol-making factory. At the age of eighteen, he headed west, finding employment as a school teacher in Missouri. Suffering from poor health, he soon returned to New England and continued to carry out physically laborious jobs in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. </p>
							<p>Desiring a better education in order to advance professionally, Dolbear enrolled in Ohio Wesleyan University. As a result of his upstanding performance, he soon became an assistant in both the Physics and Chemistry Departments. He graduated in 1866 following two years of study and became an assistant instructor in the Chemistry Department the University of Michigan. He received two degrees, an M.A. and a M.E. from Michigan. Dolbear then assumed the position of assistant professor of Natural History at Kentucky University. After two years he moved on to become professor of Physics and Chemistry at Bethany College in 1868.In 1869, he married Alice Hood, with whom he had six children. Before leaving West Virginia, he served as the Bethany's mayor from 1871-1872.</p>
							<p>In 1874, Dolbear arrived at Tufts College, accepting the chair of the Physics and Astronomy Department and continued to pursue his interest of the study of the convertibility of sound into electricity. He stayed at the college for the remainder of his academic career. </p>
							<p>Dolbear contributed many notable inventions to the scientific world, including the static telephone, the electric gyroscope used to demonstrate the Earth's rotation, the opeidoscope, and a new system of incandescent lighting. His research on the static telephone was conducted in his laboratory on the top floor of Ballou Hall, and the first transmissions using the device were made from Ballou to his house on Professors Row. He published several books, articles, and pamphlets, including "Matter, Ether, Motion," and was recognized for his contributions to science at both the Paris Exposition in 1881 and the Crystal Palace Exposition in 1882.</p>
							<p>Dolbear was amember of the American Association ofArts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and an examiner at the World's Fair. </p>
							<p>Dolbear was one of only three faculty members to offer unqualified support of the College's decision to admit women beginning in 1892. In 1905-6, he became the first faculty member to be granted permission for a full academic year's leave with pay prior to the establishment of a sabbatical leave program in 1908.</p>
							<p>Dolbear died in February of 1910 following a long illness. </p>

							<head>The Drug Bust, 1970</head>
							<p> On March 28, 1970, at 1:30 in the morning, eighty-five state and local police officers raided seventeen university premises and four off campus locations in a large scale drug bust. Sixteen people were arrested, including twelve students, and in the following two weeks, police arrested eight more students in connection with the raid.</p>
							<p>Three weeks prior to the raid, police arrested a non-Tufts student found operating an LSD lab in the basement of the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. Police suspected that the man was operating in collusion with Tufts students, but did not have any concrete proof. For the next couple of weeks, however, police began working in close cooperation with university officials to uncover serious drug use on campus. University officials provided Medford police with information that they had gathered internally, specifically about rumors of heroin use on campus. The week before the bust, a Tufts student also went to the Medford police to inform them of heroin use at Tufts. </p>
							<p>On the morning of March 28, police armed with search warrants and using master keys provided by the administration, raided the campus. Rooms in Carmichael, Miller, Hill, and Wren were searched, along with numerous campus houses. Police discovered a large quantity of narcotics and paraphernalia, including marijuana, LSD, and hashish. As news of the bust spread across campus, over three hundred students congregated on the residential quad, blocking police vehicles and throwing stones. Several police cars were damaged before the was dispersed.</p>
							<p>At 2:15 the same morning, 250 students gathered in the Carmichael lounge to discuss the raid and gather any relevant information. They gathered money to post bail for the arrested students, and planned a major rally for the next afternoon. At 9:00, the sixteen who had been arrested were arraigned before Middlesex Country Superior Court on charges ranging from presence to intent to distribute, and a trial date was set for April 14.</p>
							<p>At 1:00 in the afternoon on March 29, 800 students gathered for a rally on the residential quad. After much discussion, the students made six demands to the administration. Among other demands they asked that the university pay all the legal costs of those arrested, that no university discipline be taken against those arrested or implicated, and that no information about Tufts students, either personal or political, be given to outside persons or agencies without the permission of the student. Many students felt that the raid was aimed directly at dissidents and black radicals, who were being targeted by police across the country. The university's part in the raid infuriated students, and they demanded open access to all of the university's student files. Although Dean Schmidt assured students that no information about personal or political beliefs was on file, and that the raid would have happened without university involvement, students remained angry. </p>
							<p>In the week following the bust, students continued to protest, while police arrested eight more students who hadn't been home at the time of the original raid. By the end of the trial, the courts found five students innocent, while eighteen others were given probation terms ranging from six months to two years. One case was dropped due to inadmissible evidence. After the initial furor died down, the Tufts and the CSL quietly terminated all action against those involved in the bust. The raid, however, remains the largest one time police raid on the Tufts campus, and was one of the closing events to a turbulent year at Tufts University. </p>

							<p> Henry Watson Dudley (1831-1906) was one of the seven original faculty members of the Tufts College Medical School and served as its first professor of Pathology.</p>
							<p>Dudley was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, on November 30, 1831.He graduated from Gilmanton Academy in 1851 and went on to teach for eight years in high schools in two New Hampshire towns, Pittsfield Academy, and then in Culpepper, Virginia. He married the first of his three wives, Mary Ann Lougee, in 1854. They had five children together before her death in 1873. While working at Pittsfield, Dudley studied the rudiments of medicine under a local physician and attended lectures at Dartmouth College. In 1864, he finished his studies at Harvard University and opened a medical practice in Abington, Massachusetts which he maintained for the remainder of his life. In 1876, he married Priscilla Ellis, who died in 1888. Dudley married Sarah Marchant in the same year. </p>
							<p>He joined the Tufts College Medical School faculty in 1893 as the professor of Pathology, a position he held for seven years before becoming Emeritus Professor in 1900. From 1901 to1906, Dudley was a lecturer on Legal Medicine and, as an instructor, delivered a series of lectures entitled "Morals in Medical Practice." Dudley died on December 29, 1906.</p>
							<p>Very active in fraternal andmedical organizations, Dudley served as a Fellow and Councilor of the Massachusetts Medical Society. He also was a member of the group's Committee of Medical Ethics, working in 1881 with other notable physicians to establish a uniform standard for admission to the society.

							<figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.001.087.00001.04427"><head>Edward Dugger, Jr., May, 1940</head></figure>
							<p>Edward "Eddie" Dugger, Jr. (1919-75), E1941, was one of the most outstanding and beloved athletes in the long history of Tufts athletics. He was frequently referred to as the "one man track team" during his college days.</p>
							<p>Edward Dugger Jr., born November 30, 1919, was a Medford native and came from a hard-working, successful family. His widowed mother, who put all of her kids through college, was chosen as Massachusetts Mother of the Year in 1952.His sister Madeleine was the first African-American woman elected to the Medford school committee, and his father Lt. Col. Edward Dugger Sr. was one of the first African-American men to achieve a rank so high in the military. His brother, Cortland Dugger E1950, also attended Tufts.</p>
							<p>Dugger, not to be outdone by his family members, was one of the first African-American aeronautical engineers in the nation, and he worked for thirty-three years at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base, where the Dugger Memorial Auditorium has been named in his honor. A captain in the Air Force Reserves, Dugger was a Thirty-third Degree Freemason and Grand Master of the Ohio Masons. Alongside his track efforts, Dugger played amateur baseball and occasionally boxed. He married teacher Wertha Reid on May 27, 1943, in Dayton, Ohio, and they produced three children, son Edward III and daughters Kountez and Wrisa. In 1970, Dugger was elected to the Tufts Alumni Council, but his term was cut short by his untimely death in 1975.</p>
							<p>Dugger competed, and won, in dashes, high and low hurdles, long and high jumps, and the relay. He was a National Collegiate Hurdles Champion, and in 1940 won the IC4A championship with three teammates. He captained that 1940 team to an undefeated season, and won this accolade from President Hallowell:"Ed Dugger is a legend here... he is loved and cherished by Tufts people and one of the great figures in its history."In his three year varsity career Dugger captured forty-nine individual titles and set the IC4A high hurdles record which would remain untied and unbroken for twenty-five years. The outbreak of World War II was the only hurdle Dugger could not leap, as it prevented him from reaching the Olympics. An attempt to reach the international stage in 1948, when Dugger was past his prime, fell short as he finished fourth, one spot out of qualification. The final tally registers seven IC4A championships for Dugger.</p>
							<p>As a student he excelled, earning election to the Sword and Shield in his sophomore year, and Tower Cross in his senior term. In addition he received the Bennett Memorial Scholarship his senior year. The 1941 Jumbo Book records the esteem in which he was held by his classmates:"We will never forget Eddie Dugger, who is one of the finest athletes Tufts ever had. He is unaffected by the fame he has attained, and his leadership and ability will never be forgotten."</p>
							<p>Edward Dugger Jr. died at the age of fifty-five, September 3, 1975, from a recurring cancer of the kidneys.</p>

							<p>Durkee was born in North Tunbridge, Vermont, on October 5, 1861.Not from a wealthy family, Durkee worked in order to obtain an education, attending the Vermont Normal School and Goddard Seminary. He graduated from Tufts in 1888.In 1889 he became Instructor of Chemistry and Gymnasium, and was promoted through the ranks to full Professor of Chemistry in 1917.In 1921 Tufts presented him with an honorary doctor of science degree, and in 1939 he was awarded the Ballou Medal for Distinguished Service in recognition for his service to the college.</p>
							<p>Durkee lived with his wife, Henrietta Noble Brown Durkee, and family in the house formerly located at 38 Professors Row, at a time when houses along Professors Row wereused for faculty housing. Many faculty continued to maintain small farming operations into the early years of the 20th century, including keeping horses and cows on college land. In 1917, Durkee asked that then President Bumpus sell him the grass on the lot adjacent to his house, presumably to use as fodder for his animals. President Bumpus happily granted Durkee the grass free of charge on condition that the field would be mowed a second time prior to the opening of classes in order for the lot to present a "neat appearance."</p>
							<p>The house at 38 Professors Row was known as the Brown-Durkee House until it was demolished to make way for the Mayer Campus Center.</p>

							<p> Samuel Chandler Earle (1870-1917), an English Professor teaching in the Engineering School, implemented a new approach, known as the "Tufts Method," for instructing his students. His redirection of teaching for technical students helped spread Tufts' reputation among similar institutions throughout the country.</p>
							<p>Educated at Harvard University, Earle received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1894 and his Master of Arts in 1896.Although he intended to teach Anglo-Saxon, Old English and Romance Languages, Earle was assigned, instead, to teach English to engineering students when he joined the Tufts faculty.</p>
							<p>Struggling to maintain the interests of his non-liberal arts students, Earle spent a number of years trying to convince the Tufts faculty to adopt a new system of teaching, which would encourage the engineering students to develop their thoughts and ideas by expressing them through writing. </p>
							<p>After his ideas were accepted and instituted, writing, instead of literature, was emphasized in the Engineering School classes, making use of the textbook Earle authored, "The Theory and Practice of Technical Writing."Referring to his teaching approach as the "Tufts Method," Earle continued to promote technical writing and encourage its use by other schools despite his failing health in 1914. </p>
							<p>Earle continued to work, writing for scientific magazines, corresponding with other colleges, authored at least one other textbook and was an active in the Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, until his death in July 1917, at age of forty-seven. </p>
							<p>Earle House, located at 45 Sawyer Avenue, was built by Earle in 1907 and was occupied by his family until 1927.</p>

							<p>After hearing about the Samaritans hotline in Boston, Tufts community member Judi Goldstein decided to bring a similar program to the university. Enlisting a group of eighty-five volunteers over the summer of 1989, Goldstein set up a completely confidential call in network for students at Tufts. The volunteers, who were eventually narrowed down to twenty-five, underwent intensive training during orientation week, attending seminars with representatives from the Samaritans, the Massachusetts Drug and Alcohol Hotline, and Health Services, among others. </p>
							<p>The service, operational between seven in the evening and seven in the morning, refers to itself as "emotional first aid." Students are encouraged to call Ears for Peers if they need to talk about anything. Ears for Peers also takes referrals from TEMS, and can refer students to counseling services when necessary as well. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Ears for Peers continues to operate as a confidential help line, urging students with any concerns or problems to call. </p>

							<p>
								<placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> was built in 1860, at a cost of $19,191.90, to address the continuing need for dormitory space on the Medford campus. In the 1960s it was converted into classroom and office space, and continues to be used in that capacity.</p>
							<p>
								<placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> was designed by the architectural firm Lloyd &amp; Ruffing, and could accommodate fifty students in rooms on the three main floors. A dining hall was installed on the basement level, which because of the grade of the hill, had windows on three sides. This dining hall was the original commons dining hall for all of campus, but was converted into additional dormitory space after the completion of <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> to house the commons. After World War II, each of the two-person suites was converted to three-person rooms.<placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> was used for army barracks in both World War I and World War II, and in the latter was used by the Navy V-12 Program.</p>
							<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.00400"><head>East Hall, 1886</head></figure>While in use as a dormitory, <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> was the subject of numerous student complaints. The dormitory proctor for the academic year 1910-11 typed up a three page memo to the administration outlining student complaints and his recommendations for modifications that should be made to the building, including the installation of storm windows on the north and east sides of the building, repairs to the bathtubs, and the expansion of the hours that the building was to be heated in the wintertime. One of the more difficult situations arose out of the fact that the only lavatory and washing facilities were located in the basement, with the result that "certain obnoxious practices have been perpetuated" by students on the upper floors "which are not only discreditable to the college and disgusting to newcomers, but demoralizing to the finer sensibilities and personal pride of the students. The reasons should be apparent why vessels of crockery or metal could hardly become permanent fixtures in a college dormitory." He recommends that an additional "closet" be installed on the second floor to remedy this situation.</p>
							<p>In 1915, the students of <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> petitioned President Hermon Carey Bumpus as follows:</p>
							<p>"We, the undersigned, residents of <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>, Tufts College, Mass., in order to decrease the number of 'roughouses' and to improve the general behavior of aformentioned residents of said dormitory, do petition you, President of Tufts College, to allow us the use of Room 19, <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>, for a recreation room and also to permit us the use of one of the discarded pianos of the Musical Department."</p>
							<p>Use of the room and piano was granted, accompanied by a gift of fall apples from President Bumpus. The secretary of <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> wrote to thank President Bumpus for his kindness, stating that "the fellows are getting together and having 'sings' and incedentally becoming closer friends.

							<p> Charles Henry Eaton (1852-1902), A1874, was a distinguished Universalist preacher and president of New York's alumni association of Tufts graduates. Eaton Hall, constructed with funds donated by Andrew Carnegie in 1905 and opened as a library in 1908, was named in his honor.</p>
							<p>Eaton was born August 15, 1852 in Beverly, Massachusetts. He attended Dean Academy and Goddard Seminary in preparation for entering Tufts in 1870.He remained at the college for seven years, entering the Divinity School following his completion of a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1874.He served as president of the Mathetican Club and was member of Zeta Psi fraternity while an undergraduate. In 1887, Tufts conferred a Doctor of Divinity upon Eaton.</p>
							<p>In 1881, Eaton was called to the Church of the Divine Paternity in New York City, the beginning of a twenty year period of Eaton preaching and carrying on church work in New YorkWhile in the state, Eaton was president of the New York Association of the Alumni of Tufts College. He was also a noted speaker and Russell lecturer. Eaton died April 14, 1902. He was married twice, first, in 1878, to Jennie M. Thaxter, with whom he had two children, and then, in 1895 to Emily M. Stuart. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02275"><head> Eaton Hall, ca. 1955</head></figure>Eaton Hall was originally constructed in 1908 to serve as the college library, and then consisted only of the east wing of the building as it now stands. It was built with a gift of $100,000 from the Carnegie library foundation, and was one of the first of the college libraries to be built with Carnegie funds. Henry Davis Whitfield and Beverly Sedgwick King were the architects of the building.</p>
							<p>The Carnegie gift, made to Tufts in the winter of 1904, was obtained largely through the influence, beginning in 1901, of Rev. Frank Oliver Hall, and alumnus of the Tufts Divinity School (1884), a member of its faculty (1898-1940), and recipient of an honorary Tufts D.D. in 1905.He was a Universalist clergyman.</p>
							<p>Less than one third of the so-called "Carnegie Libraries," including the one at Tufts, ever bore his name. The Tufts building was designated as "Eaton Memorial Library" at the request of Carnegie's wife, Louise Whitfield Carnegie, in memory of Charles Henry Eaton, her pastor in the largest Universialist church in New York City. Eaton was a Tufts alumnus A1874, a graduate of the Tufts Divinity School (1877), and a recipient of an honorary Tufts D.D. in 1887.He officiated at Mrs. Carnegie's wedding in New York City in 1887.Eaton was also a lecturer in the Tufts Divinity School (1886-1888) and an Overseer of the Corporation (1899-1902).</p>
							<p>In 1950, the War Memorial Library wing was added to form the western wing of Eaton Hall. Designed by Arland A. Dirlam, it nearly doubled the size of Eaton Library with a large reading room, and two lounges. The building was dedicated on December 7, 1950, Pearl Harbor Day, in memory of Tufts alumni who served in the armed forces in wartime.</p>
							<p>With the completion of Wessell Library, Eaton ceased in its role as college library.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, Eaton Hall houses the Departments of Anthropology and Sociology, Classics, Political Science, and the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies. The reading room is used as a computer lab, and most of the main floor rooms are used as classrooms. </p>

							<head>Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship, 1986</head>
							<p> Education for Public Inquiry and International Citizenship (EPIIC) is a multidisciplinary program administered by the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies in the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College. Each year, EPIIC chooses a theme having to do with an international issue, and organizes around that theme a year-long colloquium for participating students culminating in a symposium held late in the academic year in which experts in the field are invited to come and speak. Stand-alone events are held throughout the year, such as speakers, screenings, and panel discussions.</p>
							<p>EPIIC's first program was held in 1986, on international terrorism. Since then, topics have included Drugs, International Security, and US Public Policy; Transformations in the Global Economy; Religion, Ethnicity, and Nationalism; and Global Games: Sports, Politics and Society.</p>
							<p>In addition to the undergraduate component of EPIIC, each year EPIIC sponsors a program, called Inquiry, for high school students. Inquiry was established in 1991.Inquiry takes as its focus the same theme as EPIIC and gives its participants the opportunity to learn through investigative methods and role-playing. Inquiry is a year-long program in which teachers work with EPIIC to develop curricular materials and integrate teaching on that year's theme into their classrooms. After learning about the topic in the classroom, participating students come together at Tufts to hold a simulation in which students role-play to address the issues involved. Curricular materials developed through Inquiry have been used by high schools around the US. </p>

Cohen Arts Center was constructed in 1955 to serve as a permanent home to arts and music at Tufts University. It was named for Edward E. Cohen, a Boston industrialist and philanthropist, who was also a major donor to the School of Medicine. </p>
							<p>The Cohen Arts Center was built over the summer of 1955 at a cost of over one million dollars. Edward Cohen donated over $300,000 of the money used to build the center, the rest coming from a Jackson alumni drive. Arland A. Dirlam, E1926, was the architect who designed the building. The center was constructed to house music, art, and drama facilities, all three of which had long been neglected at the university. Music had previously been housed on Boston Avenue, in the same building as a number of engineering laboratories, and Fine Arts had occupied one small room in Ballou Hall. The new facility provided office space, classrooms, an art gallery, and a 628 seat auditorium. Alumnae Hall, completed soon after Cohen, connects the Arts Center to Jackson Gym, the former location of the Department of Dance. </p>
							<p>In 1991, the Cohen Arts Center was completely remodeled. In a nine-million dollar project, classrooms were added to the downstairs level, a sculpture gallery was built, and the Balch Arena Theater was installed in the facility. With the renovations came a new name for the building. In a formal rededication ceremony in 1991, the name was changed to the Shirley and Alex Aidekman Arts Center, recognizing the support of the Aidekman family in paying for renovations to the building. Cohen, however, remains the namesake for the auditorium located inside. The entire building still serves as home to the Department of Drama and Dance, and also houses most of the classrooms used by the Department of Music. </p>

							<head>Edward R. Murrow Center, 1965</head>
							<p> The Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy was established in 1965 as a memorial to Edward R. Murrow, whose distinguished reporting and analysis of world news and imaginative leadership of the United States Information Agency set a standard of excellence in the field. The center sponsors professional workgroups, conferences and research travel grants, and conducts research in the fields of international communications, public diplomacy, and telecommunications technology and policy.</p>
							<p>Edward R. Murrow is considered by many to be the exemplary twentieth century American journalist. His career in print, radio, and television news coincided with epochal events such as the bombing of London, the birth of the Cold War and the Kennedy Presidency. It was under President Kennedy that Murrow, after resigning from CBS, rose to his highest position in public life, as the first head of the United States Information Agency. USIA's mandate had been to tell the world about America and to establish people to people contacts in the interest of developing friendly and mutually beneficial relationships between the American people and the population of the rest of the world. Kennedy asked Murrow to head the USIA because of the tremendous respect and credibility Murrow had at home and around the world. Illness, however, cut Murrow's tenure at USIA short. After leaving USIA in 1965, Murrow accepted an invitation from the Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Edmund Gullian, to head a Center for Public Diplomacy named after him. Gullian had previously coined the phrase 'public diplomacy' to describe the mix of cultural and student exchange and outreach programs as well as the use of radio and other media to inform, educate and entertain foreign publics as well as to learn the views of others about the United States and U.S. policy actions. Unfortunately, Murrow died before he assumed the position of heading the newly created center which was instead dedicated to his memory. The center was inaugurated in 1966 by Vice-President Hubert Humphrey.</p>
							<p>The Murrow Center was established at the height of the Cold War and played an important role in the training of students for careers in public diplomacy,international cultural exchanges, and communications. The Center also served as an intellectual resource for USIA by hosting each year a senior officer on sabbatical as a Murrow Fellow and providing him/her with the opportunity of doing independent research and teaching subjects related to public diplomacy.</p>
							<p>The end of the Cold War and the rise of new communications technologies brought about a shift in the Murrow Center's activities. Telecommunications and information technology as essential aspects of public diplomacy now complement its classical journalism heritage.</p>
							<p>The Murrow Center is located in Goddard Hall at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Murrow's library is housed in the Murrow Memorial Reading Room which also serves as a special seminar classroom and meeting room for Fletcher activities. </p>

							<p> Founded in 1926 as the Nursery Training School by Abigail Eliot and Mrs. Henry Greenleaf Pearson, the Eliot-Pearson Children's School is a laboratory school serving eighty children in preschool through second grade. Classrooms are fully integrated, including children with special needs and children and families from diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. The school is an early-childhood program, modeling innovative developmental education and curricula. Observation facilities and practicum sites provide training and research opportunities for Tufts undergraduate and graduate students and early-childhood professionals from across New England. The school also offers a range of programming for parents and families.</p>
							<p>The origins of the school lie in the work of Eliot and Pearson, who, under the auspices of the Women's Education Association founded a number of nursery schools in the Boston area including the Ruggles Street School in 1922. In 1951 the Nursery Training School entered into a cooperative agreement with Tufts, and the school was administered as an independent entity under the College of Special Studies. In 1955 the name was changed to the Eliot-Pearson Children's School and in 1964 became a part of the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study (now the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development). </p>

The nursery school was located in what had been the maintenance building. </p>
							<p>A yearlong fund drive to build new Eliot Pearson facilities raised $371,000 in 1962. Construction began on a modern, sky-lighted building for the new children's school when half of the total funds raised were recieved by the university. The new building housed the Lucile C. Pitcher Nursery School, a kindergarten, and a first grade. Each classroom had one way observational mirrors installed so that visitors and students could watch classroom operations without interrupting. </p>
							<p>The building was gutted by fire, however, in November 1978. The three-alarm blaze, blamed on faulty wiring, caused between $500,000 and $600,000 worth of damage. Almost immediately, the school moved its classes to Haskell Hall in order to continue operations, and soon after moved into the Hooper Lounge in <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName>.</p>
							<p>School officials and benefactors raised $26,000 to supplement the building's insurance money, and renovations on the fire-damaged building included new offices, an administrative area, and a seminar room. As the renovations progressed, another $140,00 was raised. </p>
							<p>The Smith Foundation donated $120,000 to Eliot Pearson for further renovations in 1994.The primary goal of the new changes was to establish a more "kid-friendly" atmosphere throughout the building. The reception desk, for example, was lowered so that children could see over it. The walls were also repainted and redecorated.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, the Eliot Pearson Children's School continues to operate on the Tufts campus, offering degree candidates the opportunity to gain valuable teaching experience. </p>

							<head>Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development, 1964</head>
							<p> The Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Development was founded in 1964 as a part of the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College, but its history extends much further back. The department's origins lie in the dedicated work of Abigail A. Eliot and Mrs. Henry Greenleaf Pearson, who together as part of the Women's Education Association, founded a number of nursery schools in the area in the 1920s and 1930s including the Ruggles Street School in 1922.Under the leadership of Eliot and Pearson, the Nursery Training School was established in 1926 in Boston to train nursery school teachers. Eliot's firm belief that a college education was essential in this work led her to seek out a cooperative relationship with Tufts to provide for post-secondary education opportunities for teachers of young children. Her early contacts with Tufts led to the establishment in 1951 of a cooperative relationship between Tufts and the Nursery Training School which was administered as an independent school under the College of Special Studies. In 1955, the name was changed to Eliot-Pearson Children's School and, in 1964, it became a major department of Tufts University, renamed the Eliot-Pearson Department of Child Study. In 1996, the department changed its name from Child Study to Child Development.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, the department offers courses of study for both undergraduate and graduate students.

							<head>Elizabeth Van Huysen Mayer Campus Center, 1983</head>
							<p> The Elizabeth Van Huysen Mayer Campus Center, located on the Medford campus, was built from 1983 to 1985 to serve as a central gathering point for students, and also to act as a link between the uphill and downhill sections of campus.</p>
							<p>On May 9, 1983, groundbreaking took place for the construction of the Mayer Campus Center. It had been perhaps the longest-awaited construction project in the history of Tufts University. The first call for the construction of a campus center had come in 1913, when then Dean of Liberal Arts Frank G. Wren stated that Tufts needed a gathering point for students and student activities. Calls for the center continued until, by 1976, even the faculty was agitating for its construction. By this time, a joint committee of students and administrators had been formed to look into the financial feasibility of constructing a new campus center. Moved forward in part by an anonymous grant of $1.25 million in 1980, the plans for the Mayer Campus Center were finalized in 1982. </p>
							<p>Built on the former site of the Brown-Durkee House and Graves House, and designed by architects Patrick J. Walsh and Sons, the Mayer Campus Center held its grand opening on February 1, 1985. It houses two small restaurants, the Student Activities office, ATM machines, a coffee bar, meeting rooms, a lounge, and a central information booth. </p>
							<p>The Mayer Campus Center continues in 2000 to serve as useful resource and busy gathering place for members of the Tufts community. </p>

							<head>Ellen C. Myers Memorial Prize, 1982</head>
							<p> The Ellen C. Myers Memorial Prize was established in 1982 in honor of Ellen Myers, J1982, an example of great courage and mental fortitude as she pursued her degree while battling an incurable illness. The prize is to be awarded to a junior or senior who has shown character, diligence, and perseverance in achieving high scholarship standards in the face of adverse circumstances while working toward a bachelor's degree.</p>
							<p>Ellen C. Myers was born November 1, 1958, to Robert L. and Lee Myers. She enrolled at Tufts in September 1976. Six weeks into the first semester and shortly before her eighteenth birthday she was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. She returned home to the Philadelphia area for treatment and went into remission in spring 1977. That fall she returned to Tufts while receiving chemotherapy in Boston. In 1979, Tufts awarded her the Gemma Cifarelli Memorial Scholarship, seeing this as a way to recognize her remarkable effort and determination. During summer school that year she suffered a relapse and returned to Philadelphia for treatment. Her leukemia went into remission again at the end of 1979 as a result of chemotherapy that also caused several episodes of hair loss. Starting in July 1979 she had daily high fevers for almost two years, the cause of which was never found even though her physicians consulted with infectious disease specialists world-wide. Because of this and other complications she was allowed to take classes at Temple University for Tufts credit, and she never missed a class there, receiving straight As. In January 1982,she suffered a second relapse and Tufts arranged for her to receive her diploma in February while hospitalized. She graduated cum laude (had the Temple grades been accepted she would have graduated magna cum laude). She died March 26, 1982.</p>
							<p>Ellen was very pleased by the prize she received and desired to be commemorated in a like way. In the summer of 1982, her parents established the Ellen C. Myers Memorial Prize to be awarded to students for achieving high scholarship standards in the face of adverse circumstances. </p>

Ellis (1906-1967), A1929, fondly known as "Fish," served as Chairman of the Physical Education Department at Tufts and director of intramural sports for fourteen years. He is considered to be one of the college's all-time athletic greats and was the first student to earn varsity letters in four sports.</p>
							<p>Ellis was born in Norwood, Massachusetts, in 1906. His family moved to the fishing port of Gloucester, Massachusetts,where he gained the nickname "Fish," and then to Medford in 1922.He graduated from Medford High School and entered Tufts in 1925, majoring in Civil Engineering. Ellis became one of the greatest football players ever to attend Tufts, quarterbacking the undefeated team in 1927 and serving as team captain in 1928.He lettered in football, basketball, baseball and track during his undergraduate career, winning All New England honors in each. Following his graduation in 1929, Ellis worked as a teacher and athletic director at Bridgton Academy in Maine. He moved on in 1934 to serve as coach and math teacher in Beverly, Massachusetts, for six years. In 1931, he married his college sweetheart, Dorothea Loughlin. She graduated from Jackson College in the morning; they were married in the afternoon; and then the newly-weds attended the Senior Prom that night. In 1940, Ellis was appointed athletic director, coach, and instructor at Dean Academy in Franklin, Massachusetts. A major in the Army Air Corps from March 1943 to June 1946, Ellis served with the Third Air Commando group in New Guinea, the Philippines, the Caroline Islands, and Japan. Before entering the military, Ellis had been an assistant coach at Tufts and renewed his involvement with the university as assistant professor of physical education and head coach of the football team in 1946.By 1954 he had attained the position of full professorship of physical education and was also coaching the basketball and golf teams, in addition to football. Ellis died unexpectiedly on July 19, 1967, in Burlington, Massachusetts. The Ellis family had lived on campus, at 108 Packard Avenue, until 1960, when they moved to Burlington. The Ellis' two daughters were also graduates of Jackson College.</p>

							<p> The Tufts European Center is located in Talloires, France, in a priory built in the twelfth century. The priory was purchased in 1958 by Donald MacJannet, A1916, H1979, and his wife Charlotte, H1979, and used as a summer camp site for several years before the MacJannets gave the campus to Tufts in 1978.</p>
							<p>Talloires lies on the shore of Lake Annecy in the French Alps, an hour's drive from Geneva, Switzerland. The masonry and stone priory is located on an acre and a half of lawns and gardens overlooking the lake.</p>
							<p>Each year the center hosts a number of summer study programs. Tufts in Talloires is for undergraduates and offers six-week, full-credit courses on topics of international interest. Student enrolled in the program live with local families. French in Annecy offers intensive instruction in French language at the college level. Tufts Summit is a program for high school juniors or seniors and offers an introduction to the study of international relations as well as a homestay experience. France Before France is a program for college students on the archaeology of the region, in which students participate in a local dig to learn first-hand about archaeological techniques. Landscape Drawing and Painting is a non-credit course which takes advantage of the scenery around Talloires to teach about landscape painting techniques. The center also administers internships for two students from the College of Engineering to work at a local stainless-steel processing plant. Finally, there is L'Anglais American d'Aujourd'hui, an English as a Second Language program for French nationals, which brings students age eighteen and older to the priory for instruction and to interact with the American students there. </p>

							<p>Portraits of the Association reveal dapper young men in white ties and tails.

							<p>	The organization faded away as World War II approached and its last known dance occurred the second week of December, 1940.It was to be a 'gala affair' with music from Ted Marks, a man heralded as "second only to Gene Krupa in the skin-beating industry," - and all that for only $1.50.</p>

							<p>Fletcher was born on March 13, 1852, in Mendon, Massachusetts, to descendants of an early settler of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During his youth, his family moved to Franklin, where his parents had the supervision of the boarding department of Dean Academy. Fletcher entered the Universalist-chartered coeducational preparatory school, considered to be a "feeder" for Tufts College, in 1867.After attending the academy for three years, Fletcher moved on to Wilbraham Academy before matriculating at Tufts in 1872.He obtained a B.A. from the college in 1876 and returned to Dean Academy to teach Oratory. He later taught at Boston University and Brown University. During this time he published two books on the subject of oratory training.</p>
							<p>Fletcher continued his studies at Boston University Law School, receivingLL.B. (1879) andM.A. (1880) degrees. Fletcher began practicing law in New York City in 1882, spending the remainder of his life there, serving as counsel for many large corporations and trustee of several substantial estates. He eventually became president and primary stock holder of the prominent law firm Eppinger and Russell. In January 1882, Fletcher married Hortense M. Follett, who died in 1905. </p>
							<p>Active in several organizations,Fletcher served as president of both the New England Society of New York and the National Institution of Social Sciences. He was a trustee of Dean Academy and Boston University and was also president of the Fletcher Family Union, which had 10,000 enrolled members. Fletcher was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Zeta Psi fraternity, and a Templar Knight.</p>
							<p>Fletcher delivered the oratory at Tufts' semi-centennial celebration in 1905.In 1909, he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts College, serving as its president from 1913-23.Through Fletcher's coordination of bequests and his own generosity, the college received many substantial gifts. His personal friend and client, Henry J. Braker, bestowed $500,000 on the college after visiting campus only once, during the semi-centennial, to hear Fletcher's speech. The gift was intended to further the study of economics on campus.</p>
							<p>Fletcher made Tufts the principal beneficiary of his estate, including bequests to establish five endowed professorships in oratory, English, music, philosophy, and public speaking and debate, a bequest to establish a school of law and diplomacy (The Fletcher School), and funds for the construction and maintenance of new buildings. He died July 5, 1923, at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in New York.</p>
							<p>Fletcher Hall, a residence hall built in 1926, was originally named in honor of Fletcher. In 1991, it was renamed Blakeley Hall. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01752"><head>Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy; Drawing and Reality, ca. 1960</head></figure> The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy was established in 1933 by a bequest from Austin Barclay Fletcher, late president of the Board of Trustees and lifetime benefactor of Tufts. Fletcher's gift of $1,000,000 was intended to finance a school of law and diplomacy, but it was nearly ten years after his death before the Fletcher School opened its doors. When it did so, in the midst of the Great Depression and with the collaboration of Harvard University, the Fletcher School became the first graduate-only school of international affairs in the United States.</p>
							<p>As envisioned by Fletcher and President Cousens, the Fletcher School was to have occupied a new building on the Medford Campus, situated next to Miner Hall. However, as the financial uncertainties brought on by the Depression increased, it was decided to open the school in the old Goddard Gymnasium instead, with the understanding that dramatic renovations would be made to make the building habitable. Classroom and office space was provided in the building, but the focus of the renovations was to provide a home for the school's library. In 1964, Mugar Hall was built adjacent to Goddard Hall to provide additional office space and dining facilities for Fletcher students. In 1981 the Cabot Intercultural Center was added to the complex, linking Goddard and Mugar Halls. The Cabot Center provided a large auditorium and seven floors of offices for faculty and administrators of the school.</p>
							<p>The library of the Fletcher School was one of the thorniest problems presented to the school's founders. The books, serials, and other publications deemed necessary to support the curriculum of a school such as Fletcher were absent from the college library and to acquire them would have constituted a major expense at a time when finances were extraordinarily tight. Problems over how to manage the library contributed to the delayed opening of the school. After several years of discussions and negotiations, a solution was presented in 1933 when the World Peace Foundation, at the prompting of Fletcher's Acting Dean Hoskins and thanks to groundwork laid by President Cousens, offered to donate its library of 40,000 volumes to the institution to form the basis for a suitable collection. In subsequent years the Foundation maintained many of the periodical subscriptions essential to the collection.</p>
							<p>Harvard's involvement with the Fletcher School began in the planning stages, when Tufts President John Cousens opened discussions with several individuals at Harvard in 1930 concerning the proposed school. Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School, was sufficiently intrigued by the possibilities to bring the plan to the attention of the president of Harvard. Cooperation between Harvard and Tufts in the development of Fletcher was seen to bring assets to both institutions, and in 1932, a plan was developed by which Tufts and Harvard would manage Fletcher. According to this agreement, a Joint Executive Committee was formed with members from Tufts and Harvard, and professors were to be chosen from the faculties of both institutions. The deanship of the Fletcher School was to be held by Tufts and the school was to be located on the Medford Campus. This agreement ultimately served as the basis on which the Fletcher School was built. However, within a short time the agreement was under discussion again as Harvard registered objections to the manner in which administration of the school had evolved. A revised agreement signed in 1934 reworked the participation of Harvard in the administration of the school and was the foundation for the duration of Harvard's involvement with Fletcher. As a result of this agreement, Fletcher was officially known as "The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, administered by Tufts College, with the cooperation of Harvard University." </p>
							<p>While initially conceived to offer a Ph. D. degree in addition to a masters degree, it was quickly apparent that the new school would not be able to offer the resources necessary to support such a program. Instead, students were offered the choice of obtaining either a Master of Arts degree after one year of study or the specially designed Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy (MALD) after two years of study and successful completion of a thesis and examination by the faculty. Students chose to concentrate in either Public and International Law, Diplomacy and International Relations, or International Economics. The focus was to be on preparing students for foreign service or international business, and to that end, the school sought to build a small student body of exceptionally qualified students. Twenty-one students entered Fletcher in October 1933, all with bachelor's degrees and four already holding a master's. They were expected to have reading knowledge of French or German - if not both - and a thorough grounding in history, government, and economics. </p>
							<p>Faculty staffing was an ongoing issue in the early years of the school. As initially conceived, Fletcher was to have a full-time resident faculty supplemented by adjuncts from Tufts and Harvard. However, it initially proved to be a difficult task to attract faculty of sufficient caliber at the salaries that Fletcher was able to offer. The first full-time faculty member, Dr. Norman J. Padelford, professor of International Law and Organization, was not appointed until 1936-37.</p>
							<p>Housing for Fletcher students was acquired in 1936 with the purchase of Wilson House on Winthrop Street. In 1939 Blakeslee House, on Curtis Street, was added to house women students at Fletcher. Both houses were named for original members of the Fletcher faculty. In the early 1960s Fletcher was given Fletcher Hall to use as a dormitory for its students, and Wilson House and Blakeslee House were returned to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</p>
							<p>After World War II, Fletcher instituted specialized training programs for career diplomats in other countries. The first such program was in 1949, for the diplomatic corps of newly independent Pakistan. Since then, programs have been run for groups from Kuwait, Qatar, and others.</p>
							<p>When student protests against the United States' involvement in Vietnam and the presence of ROTC and in-service training officers on campus and particularly the Fletcher School reached a peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Fletcher became the focus of student anger. Dean Guillon of the Fletcher School was an outspoken supporter of the US role in Vietnam and the presence of military personnel on campus, prompting student outrage. In 1970 students firebombed Dean Guillon's office in Mugar Hall, causing an estimated $70,000 in damage.</p>
							<p>In 1973-74 a combined degree program with the <orgName n="College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College">College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College</orgName> was instituted in which highly qualified undergraduates would be admitted at the end of the Junior year to work toward both the B.A. and the Fletcher M.A.Because Fletcher's student body has traditionally been made up of students with experience in the field, either in diplomatic service or international business, as well as grounding in multiple foreign languages, very few undergraduates have been admitted to the program.</p>
							<p>As of 2005, Fletcher enrolls an average of 350 students per year, from the United States and more than seventy countries around the world. Students choose from fields of study including Public International Law, International Organizations, International Business and Economic Law, Law and Development, United States, Europe, Asia, Southwest Asia and Islamic Civilization, International Information and Communication, International Negotiation and Conflict Resolution, International Trade and Commercial Policies, International Monetary Theory and Policy, Development Economics, International Environment and Resource Policy, International Technology Policy and Management, Political Systems and Theories, International Security Studies, Comparative and Developmental Political Analysis, International Political Economy, and International Business Relations.</p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Football, 1875" id="F00006">
							<head>Football, 1875</head>
							<p> The history of American college football and the history of football at Tufts are, surprisingly, closely intertwined. Although several colleges claim the honor, it seems that the first true football game between two American colleges took place on June 4, 1875, when Tufts College beat Harvard 1-0 at Jarvis Field in Cambridge, Massachusetts. </p>
							<p>Although Princeton and Rutgers claimed to have played the first football game on November 6, 1869, their game was basically a rough version of soccer, and carrying the ball and tackling were forbidden. Tufts students first learned of the game during a rugby match between Harvard and McGill University in May, 1874. The game was played with rugby rules, but was seen as an early version of football. Several Tufts students attended the game, and challenged Harvard to a match the following year. Using the recently established "Boston rules" for football, Tufts handed Harvard its first ever football loss. Although there are almost no records of the game, players recount that Scott Campbell scored the game's only touchdown behind a block from Austin Fletcher with Francis Harrington kicking the extra point. After the completion of the match, Tufts players ran all the way back to the hill, rang the bell at Ballou, and celebrated with a buffet supper, toasts, and speeches. </p>
							<p>Football had been present on the Tufts campus informally since at least 1864. The first issue of Tuftonia reported that football was becoming quite popular, and by 1875, it had almost superseded baseball as the most popular sport on campus. </p>
							<p>After the first game against Harvard, Tufts took its squad to Bates College for the first football game played in Maine. The next year, Harvard avenged its loss to Tufts, and football on campus mostly disappeared until 1884, when the team was again quite successful. On October 9, 1885, the Tufts Football Association entered the Northern Intercollegiate Football Association, the first official college football league in the northeast, and finished the year with a two and four record. In 1887, Tufts withdrew from the league, and would remain independent for eighty years. </p>
							<p>Tufts hired its first official football coach, A.G. Baillet, in 1892. The team's record that year caused enough excitement around campus to bring about the construction of a large oval with grounds for both football and baseball. The oval was completed and ready for use by 1895. </p>
							<p>In 1902, Tufts produced its first All-American. Captain Tom Knight, a fullback, was named to the team as a substitute behind a Harvard player. In 1906, Tufts joined the Intercollegiate Athletic Association in an attempt to limit the roughness of the game and the attention played to athletics. The 1906 team was quite good, with only two teams scoring more than one touchdown against them all season. Soon after, in 1908, Tufts became a charter member of the New England College Conference on College Athletics. The membership allowed Tufts to limit the amount of time the team had to travel, and also the number of games played annually.</p>
							<p>Between 1908 and 1912, Tufts football was generally unsuccessful. Coach Charles Whelan, who had come to Tufts in 1903 and became a major innovator among coaches in the east, had left to resume his medical practice in 1908.Whelan returned to Tufts in 1912, however, and helped to put the struggling program back on its feet. In a 1912 game versus Bowdoin College, Whelan used the first ever Minnesota Shift, a play in which both tackles begin in the backfield and shift to one side of the line to outflank the defense. In 1913, Tufts went almost unbeaten, losing only one game. Their one loss became the most famous and remembered game of the season, as a prominent West Point sophomore halfback named Dwight D. Eisenhower had his leg broken halfway through the match.</p>
							<p>During the 1913 season, Clarence "Pop" Houston established himself as one of the team's strongest players. He played guard and fullback for all four years at Tufts, and returned to Tufts as Manager of Athletics in 1920. From there he went on to be Director of Athletics, and in 1953, became the Tufts Vice President for Development. He also served as the President of the NCAA from 1955-1957. </p>
							<p>The 1913 team also lays claim to another major innovation in football. After a loss to Army, Tufts player George Angell, one of the first in football to throw the long pass, sent information to Notre Dame recommending that they try a short pass offense. Notre Dame then completed thirteen of fourteen passes and upset Army 35-13. The overwhelming publicity surrounding the Notre Dame game, seen as the first game to utilize a short pass offense, drowned out Tufts' role in the game. </p>
							<p>In 1914, William F. Brown became the first African-American Jumbo to play football, and his quickness made him quite a force at left tackle. 1916 also brought prestige to Tufts football, as Tufts defeated Harvard for the first time since 1875, and also became the first team to use the huddle on offense. The crowd and the band at a game versus the University of Indiana were so loud that the quarterback couldn't call the plays. Instead, he had the players huddle and then simply counted at the line. Although the claim is disputed because the huddle was not planned in advance, it does seem to be the first time it appeared during a game. </p>
							<p>After seeing Tufts football wane during the First World War, Edward L. Casey was hired as coach in 1922. For two years, the Tufts team thrived, but it again faltered in 1924 and 1925. 1926, however, saw the coming of one of Tufts' all time greats. Fred "Fish" Ellis became a force on the 1926 team, and in 1927 led the team to its first undefeated, untied record. Also during the 1927 season, Tufts hired its first full-time football coach, Arthur Sampson. </p>
							<p>In 1930, Sampson left Tufts, and Lewis F. Manly became the new coach. Manly and the Tufts defense then led the team to its second undefeated season in 1934. That year, the defense allowed only one touchdown in eight games, and scored nearly as many times as the offense. Tufts next strong season was not until 1943, when, bolstered in part by Navy recruits, Tufts beat Harvard for the first time since 1916 and finished with its best record in nine years. </p>
							<p>At the end of the 1945 season, Manly retired, and his duties were taken over by "Fish" Ellis. Through Ellis' seven years as coach, the team was less than spectacular, but they sent Ellis out with a winning record in 1953. Harry Arlanson was hired to replace Ellis, and had immediate success, leading the team to a six and two record in 1954. In 1956, Arlanson's Jumbos played at Harvard Stadium in front of 17,500 people and deafeated Harvard once again. In 1960, Tufts almost posted its third undefeated season, but lost the final game of the year to Lafayette. The next five years, however, were tough times for Tufts football. The team struggled, and in 1965 managed only one win all season. Arlanson retired immediately after the 1965 season, but continued as Director of Athletics at Tufts. </p>
							<p>Rocky Carzo replaced Arlanson as coach. Carzo's first season was rough, but in 1968 he revitalized the passing team and had a successful year. Carzo remained coach until 1974, when he became Director of Athletics. Carzo's successor, Paul Pawlak Jr., soon became the most controversial coach in Tufts football history. </p>
							<p>In 1976, after two reasonably successful years, Pawlak fired assistant coach James Hunt, citing differences in play calling. The move infuriated the football team, moving them to draw up a list of grievances about Pawlak's coaching and his rapport with the players. Some players even demanded Pawlak be fired, but no official action was taken. </p>
							<p>The 1976 season, despite the controversy, turned out to be quite successful. Pawlak was named New England College Division Coach of the Year for leading Tufts to its first winning season in seven years. Two years later, however, Pawlak was fired. Players claimed that Pawlak tampered with votes for team captain and threatened to reduce financial aid for players who quit the team. During Pawlak's four years as coach, over 100 players had quit the team. </p>
							<p>Vic Gatto, the former head coach at Bates, was hired to replace Pawlak. In 1979, after an undefeated season, Gatto was named New England Coach of the Year, and his quarterback, Chris Connors, won the Division Three Golden Helmet award. The next few years were disappointing, and after Tufts posted no wins in 1984, Gatto resigned and moved to Davidson College, a Division I-AA school in South Carolina. </p>
							<p>Duane Ford, the defensive assistant coach under Gatto, replaced him as head coach. Ford revamped the running game, and although his first season was disappointing, the team did manage to shut out unbeaten Amherst. After Tufts was named the number one team in the Northeast during the 1986 season, Ford was named New England Small College Coach of the Year.</p>
							<p>In 1994, after going 39-30-3 in nine years as head coach, Ford resigned to coach in New Hampshire. Bill Samko, a former assistant coach at Tufts who was coaching at the University of the South in Tennessee, returned to replace Ford as head coach. In 1998, Samko led the team to a 7-1 record and a number four ranking in New England, and was named the Coach of the Year by three separate organizations. Since 1998, the Tufts football team has had difficulties, going 4-4 in 1999 and 2-6 in 2000. </p>

							<p> The Frederic J. Shepler Memorial Prize in French was established in 1984 by alumni, friends, colleagues, and family in memory of Frederic J. Shepler, an esteemed professor of French in the Department of Romance Languages. The prize is awarded annually to that senior French major who has demonstrated high achievement in the study of French literature and in the understanding of poetry in particular.</p>
							<p>Frederic J. Shepler was born in Cambridge and grew up in Lynn. He graduated from Lynn English High School and earned an undergraduate degree from Boston University in 1962. He continued his education with a master's degree from Middlebury College in Vermont and a doctorate in French literature from Yale in 1968. He also studied at the Sorbonne for a year and a half. In 1968 he came to Tufts as associate professor of French. In 1974 he was the first faculty member to receive the Lillian and Joseph Leibner Award for excellence in teaching and advising of students. He was a specialist in twentieth-century French poetry, particularly Ren, Char, and Henri Michaux. He also wrote and translated poetry. In 1978 and 1979, he taught at Tufts Medical School and worked with its faculty to find ways to introduce the humanities into the medical school curriculum. After his death in 1984, the Department of Romance Languages established the prize in his honor. </p>

							<head>Freshman Beanies, 1854-1969</head>
							<p> From the early days of Tufts College through the late nineteen sixties, freshman males at Tufts were required to wear a beanie denoting their class every time they walked around campus. </p>
							<p>The Sword and Shield Society, the official student organization of the sophomore class and designated keeper of Tufts traditions, regulated a number of hazing rules for the freshman class. From the late nineteenth century through the mid-twentieth century, the rivalry between the classes was played up, and freshman were forced to follow a list of Sword and Shield ordinances for behavior and appearance around campus. The most noticeable rule was that all freshman males had to wear a beanie. The brown and blue beanies could be purchased at the Tufts bookstore, and were to be worn at all times unless otherwise posted. Students were required to doff their beanies when meeting the president or members of the faculty. </p>
							<p>Although the beanie tradition began to die out in the nineteen fifties, it continued nominally until the late nineteen sixties, by which time almost all of the freshman traditions had disappeared. </p>

							<head>Freshman Buttons and Bows, 1915-1969</head>
							<p> As one part of the many hasing rituals endured by freshman women, first-year Jackson students were required to wear green buttons. The tradition of button-wearing began soon after the college opened in 1910 and continuted until 1931 when, after much student complaint about the buttons ripping clothes, the sophomore class switched to using green bows. The green buttons, and later green bows, served not only to denote a freshman's class rank, but also aided sophomores in their monitoring of how closely first-year Jackson students adhered to all freshmen traditions.</p>
							<p>The green bows were worn by Jackson freshmen every day until Freshman Sing, when the bows were burned in a formal ceremony. Prior to 1931, Freshman Sing represented the day when students were allowed to remove their buttons. In 1943, however, a group of Jackson freshmen burned their bows in front of Ballou Hall in protest of the hazing ritual. The sophomore class held a special ceremony in Goddard Chapel to chastise the freshmen for their transgression. Even in the face of such protest, sophomores continued to enforce the tradition.</p>
							<p>Jackson freshmen were required to wear thier bows until the mid-1950s. During the following decade, the hazing period was shortened to only three days, with girls participating in specific activities each day. Jackson freshmen sported their green bows, tied at the required height of one inch above their hairlines, during the shortened period. Hazing rituals decreased on college campuses accross the country, however, throughout the 1960s. As a result, the tradition of bow-wearing by Jackson freshmen disappeared by the early 1970s.</p>

							<p>Born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, Canada, on April 20, 1897, Garnett moved to Boston, Massachusetts as a teenager and attended Girls High School. She enrolled in the Tufts Dental school as a member of the Class of 1919, the only African-American student, and one of just ten women. Her first offices were in a professional building on the Roxbury-South End line. She later built an office behind her home on Monroe Street in Roxbury. Due to arthritis in her hands, Garnett retired in 1969, after practicing dentistry for nearly fifty years.</p>
							<p>Garnett was a member of the NAACP and Urban League, sat on the boards of directors of the Boston YWCA, St. Mark's Congregational Church of Roxbury, and the Freedom House. Garnett had also been a charter member of the Psi Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She was married to Robert C. Garnett, with whom she had two children. She died September 5, 1976.</p>
							<p>A memorial scholarship fund for African-American female students attending the Tufts School of Dental Medicine, the Dr. Jessie Garnett - Dr. Mary Thompson Scholarship, was established by Psi Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in Garnett's memory. </p>

							<p> The Gemma Cifarelli Memorial Scholarship, established in 1956 by classmates and fellow students in memory of Gemma Cifarelli of the Class of 1957, is awarded to a junior who has combined good academic standing with participation in activities of importance to the university.</p>
							<p>Gemma Cifarelli, of Hempstead, Long Island, was a member of the class of 1957. She was a history major with a minor in psychology who took six courses a semester and was on the Dean's List. In her sophomore year she was one of the peppiest cheerleaders on the football field, described by the Tufts Weekly as "a cute, dark haired little girl who personified energy itself." Her unbounded enthusiasm and her tireless energy made her known to almost everyone at Tufts. She was planning to go to Europe and then to attend law school. In early December 1955 she died following a car accident. </p>

Located on the Medford campus on almost the exact spot of the first President's House, which now stands at 20 Professors Row, the house follows the Georgian architectural design of other campus structures also designed by Andrews, Jones, Biscoe and Whitmore.</p>
							<p> Built to face Packard Ave, leaving its backside to face what has come to be known as the President's Lawn, the house was built for President Leonard Carmichael. His predecessor, John A. Cousens, chose to reside off campus and the former president's residence, Capen House, located on Professors Row, had been altered to serve as a Jackson dormitory. The building of the new, fifteen-room structure was financed using funds made available specifically for building projects from investments bequeathed to the college by Austin B. Fletcher, A1876.</p>
							<p>The house remained unchanged until 1993, when President John A. DiBiaggio and his wife Nancy oversaw major redesigns and renovations of the structure, recognizing its importance as a "home" for the entire university. In May 1996, the house was renamed Gifford House, in honor of the past chair (1986-1995) of the Tufts Board of Trustees, Nelson S. Gifford, A1952. </p>

							<head>Ginn, Edwin, 1838-1914</head>
							<p> Edwin Ginn (1838-1914), A1862, served as a trustee for six years and was a benefactor of Tufts College. He founded the Ginn &amp; Company textbook publishing house in 1867. A noted philanthropist and peace advocate, Ginn worked closely with Andrew Carnegie to further the international peace movement.</p>
							<p>A descendent of early settlers of Maryland, Virginia, and Salem, Massachusetts, Edwin Ginn was born into a Universalist farming family living in Orland, Maine, on February 14, 1838. As a child, he attended about four months of rural school a year. At fifteen, he entered an academy in Bucksport, Maine, in search of a more formal education. He later transferred to Westbrook Seminary, a Universalist preparatory school near Portland, Maine. Ginn chose to study at Tufts in 1858 instead of entering the Universalist ministry. Graduating from Tufts with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1862, Ginn also received, through a program for exceptionally able students, his Masters of Arts at the same time.</p>
							<p>After becoming successful in the publishing world, Ginn took on a number of philanthropic causes, including the construction of low-income housing in Boston. He also worked to further the cause of peace and donated $1,000,000 to establish the World Peace Foundation in 1910.</p>
							<p>In 1902, Ginn was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from his alma mater and was elected an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
							<p>The Edwin Ginn Library at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, the first collection of which was based on the donation of the library of Ginn's World Peace Foundation, was named in his honor.</p>
							<p>Ginn married twice and fathered six children. He died on January 21, 1914, at his home in Winchester, Massachusetts, after suffering from a paralytic stroke and pneumonia a month earlier. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.011.DO.01712"><head>Goddard Chapel, ca. 1930</head></figure>Goddard Chapel, once called "the most photographed chapel in the country," was built in 1882 and officially dedicated in 1883.It was built to replace the Coolidge Room in Ballou Hall, which had served as the chapel up until that point. Goddard Chapel was large enough to accommodate the entire student body and faculty in one sitting for events.</p>
							<p>Attendance at the daily non-sectarian services was mandatory until 1907, when chapel was held three times a week until 1912.The college's president, who throughout the 19th century was an ordained clergyman, presided at all services, usually delivering a pulpit address on a moral, ethical, or community theme.</p>
							<p>The chapel was designed by J. Philip Rinn in a modified Romanesque style. It is constructed of blue-gray slate quarried in Somerville with a red slate roof. At the time of its construction it was considered an architectural tour de force. The transept to the right of the pulpit was taken in 1960 for the offices of the University Chaplaincy. Money to build the chapel was donated in 1881 by Mary Goddard in honor of her late husband, Thomas A. Goddard, a trustee and early donor. </p>
							<p>The stained glass windows in the chapel were designed by French artist Thomas Juglaris, with Rinn managing the color scheme and technique. Instead of painting on the glass, the colors were etched in, allowing more light to enter the building. The large window behind the pulpit was installed in honor of Thomas Goddard using gifts from Universalist laymen. It depicts St. Paul, wearing brown and blue robes, and contains a latin inscription from his epistles. This window was blown in and demolished by a storm in 1955, but was later restored and reinforced.</p>
							<p>The window opposite, in the rear of the building, depicts St. John the Evangelist, and was built in memory of Hosea Ballou. On the west wall there is a stained glass window depicting St. Mark, dedicated to the Hon. Richard Frothingham, father of Mary A. Goddard. The "Palm Tree" window, also on the west side, is in honor of Oliver Dean, an early donor, and the simple window depicting a wreath of oak leaves is in honor of Charles Tufts and Sylvanius Packard. All of these windows were designed and completed by Rinn and Juglaris.</p>
							<p>The three windows on the east side of the chapel also serve as memorials. The rear window on the east side memorializes Maud Russell Pitman, and simply depicts a small white lily. Close to the chancel area, a window depicting peasants sowing a field, probably inspired by a Jean Francois Millet painting, memorializes William Henry Goodrich, A1894. The final window was designed by the Alfred M. Bill company, and is in memory of Edward C. Parsons, a student who died while enrolled at Tufts. Installed in 1923, it is the newest of the stained glass windows.</p>
							<p>In addition to the windows, there are a number of memorial busts and plaques throughout the chapel. These include a memorial tablet designed by Mary Stickney in honor of William Rollins Shipman, Tufts Professor of Rhetoric in the late 1800's, and a bronze bas relief of Charles Ernest Fay, a talented linguist and founder of the Department of Modern Languages, also the namesake of Mt. Fay in Canada. Also memorialized in Goddard are Newton Talbot, a trustee and treasurer of Tufts during the 1890's, Frederick Stark Pearson, A1883, who received the first honorary Doctor of Sciences from Tufts in 1900, Benjamin Graves Brown, who served as Tufts' first endowed chair, the Walker Professor of Mathematics, John Potter Marshall, a member of the original Tufts faculty who served as acting president after Ballou's death, Alonzo Ames Miner, second president of Tufts and namesake of Miner Hall, Edwin Hubbel Chapin, a strong early supporter of Tufts, and Elmer Hewitt Capen, third president of Tufts. Goddard also contains a marble bust of Hosea Ballou. </p>
							<p>The original organ in Goddard was built by Hook and Hastings of Boston. The bells were donated in a series of gifts beginning in 1908.They ring daily at five o'clock in the afternoon and on special occasions. In 1952, lights to illuminate the tower at night were installed during celebrations for the 100th anniversary of Tufts. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Goddard Chapel is still used for Protestant and Catholic services. Once a week, it also plays host to a classical music concert, and it houses the acapella concert for incoming freshman each year at matriculation. </p>

Following the announcement, a huge bonfire was built on the hill while students cheered and rang the bell continuously.</p>
							<p>The original Goddard Gymnasium provided basic facilities, with an open main floor and locker and shower facilities located in the basement. Beginning in 1897 two hours per week of gymnasium work was required of freshmen and sophomores from Thanksgiving until spring recess. At that time Goddard Gymnasium provided the only large space suitable for holding dances or large gatherings, and was used for the commencement dinner each year.</p>
							<p>By 1898, demands on the building were such that additions were made to the front and south sides of the building, providing space for a baseball cage with a dance floor above. An indoor track was also constructed at this time at the level of the dance floor, as a gallery around the main gym area. The Department of Music was given use of rooms on the third floor of the front addition.</p>
							<p>By 1930 Goddard Gymnasium was hopelessly outgrown and as soon as the new <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName> was ready, Goddard Gym was handed over to the newly formed Fletcher School, and became known as Goddard Hall.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, Goddard Hall is still used by the Fletcher School. The main part of the building houses the Edwin Ginn Library, as well as limited office space, seminar rooms, and the Edward R. Murrow Center. The structure is connected to the Cabot Intercultural Center on its north side and Mugar Hall on the west. Where possible the original brick and woodwork has been preserved and can still be seen in the reading room and stack areas of the library. </p>

							<p>Thomas Austin Goddard was one of the prime benefactors to Tufts in its early years. He was treasurer of Tufts from 1856 to 1864 and often paid college expenses for students from his own personal funds, sometimes the equivalent of tuition for 100 students at a time. At the same time, he often slipped his own funds into the meager Tufts coffers. In 1862, he established the Goddard Rhetorical Prize, which was the first year in which the catalogue mentions any prizes. After his death in 1868, his wife Mary T. Goddard continued supporting Tufts and gave Goddard Chapel and Goddard Gymnasium as a memorial to him in 1882. </p>

Constructed entirely by students, the six hole golf course provided room for physical education classes and extra-curricular activities for almost thirty-four years. </p>
							<p>In 1923, President Cousens expressed his interest in the construction of a golf course at Tufts College, claiming it would help bring Tufts back to the forefront. In fact, although this has been subsequently disputed, Tufts claimed that its course would be the first golf course on any college campus in America. Cousens personally subsidized preliminary arrangements and expenses for the course, provided that students volunteered to construct the course. The next year, using a design by architect Wayne Stiles and his assistant John R. van-Kleck, construction began. Under the watchful eye of philosophy professor Robert C. Givler, students were asked to volunteer five hours per week towards the construction of the course. Physical education classes substituted construction work for normal activities, and within months, the golf course was completed. </p>
							<p>Although strict rules governed attire, equipment, and hours, the course was opened to all Tufts and Jackson students and faculty free of charge. After a year, however, Tufts began to require that students have experience on a golf course before using the Tufts course.</p>
							<p>The course remained intact until 1948, when the second hole was destroyed to make room for Jackson Gym. The now five-hole course remained in use, and saw its thirtieth anniversary in 1954. The same year, the course was restructured to provide room for Alumnae Hall, Hodgdon Hall, and Cohen Auditorium. The course survived, in modified form, until 1958, when it was formally closed to make room for the construction of Bush Hall and Tilton Hall. </p>

His involvement with Tufts stems from the brief time he spent on the Medford campus as a trainee in the Navy V-12 Program, and has grown to include the institute that bears his name and a pledge of $20 million to support the College of Engineering and its programs.</p>
							<p>Gordon is best known for his work in the field of high-speed analog-to-digital conversion. Fifty years ago he was a member of the team that developed the first commercially available digital computer. He led teams that went on to create breakthrough devices such as the fetal monitor, the mobile CT scan, and an advanced security imaging scanner to detect explosives and other contraband.</p>
							<p>Born and raised in Depression-era western Massachusetts, Gordon attended Springfield Technical High School and devoted his time to inventing useful devices, including an improved outhouse mechanism. After applying and being turned away from MIT at age sixteen, Gordon enrolled in the Navy's V-12 training program and came to Tufts. Gordon was at Tufts for less than a year taking courses in engineering and other subjects, but he was impressed with Tufts' friendliness when then-president Leonard Carmichael greeted him by name on a stroll across campus one day. </p>

							<head>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, 1909</head>
							<p> The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was officially founded in 1909, more than thirty years after the first graduate degree was awarded at Tufts College. </p>
							<p>In 1875, members of the Tufts faculty and administration approved a graduate program leading to a Master of Arts degree. The program required either one year of supervised study at Tufts, or the equivalent done away from the campus over a period of two years or more. Tufts graduates were eligible for the program, as were graduates from other schools with similar courses of study. The first MA was awarded the next spring, to a student working with the Departments of Chemistry and Physics. </p>
							<p>Over the next few decades, interest in graduate education skyrocketed, and Tufts saw more and more students entering the program each year. In 1897, in order to meet increased demand, a Master of Sciences program was added to the graduate curriculum. Five years earlier, Tufts had established a preliminary Ph. D. program as well. The program was specifically for work in Biology and Chemistry, with other departments to be added as the faculty saw fit. </p>
							<p>In 1892, in order to have some control over who was admitted to graduate programs, Tufts established a committee of seven faculty, led by the president. The committee picked a board of three to examine each graduate candidate and decide on their admission to the school. By the year's end, the committee was already being referred to as the graduate department. </p>
							<p>The department finally was made official in 1903, and the office of the dean of the graduate faculty became a full time position. After the official establishment of the department, the requirements for degrees were finalized. Students were to complete thirty credit hours to receive a master's degree, and the work was to be done in one main department with related work in another. </p>
							<p>By 1906, the size of the graduate program began to worry some members of the faculty. They were not being paid extra to teach graduate classes, which amounted to an extra course load of work for a faculty member working with as graduate student. The graduate department established a faculty committee to look into feasibility of continuing graduate education, and almost immediately the committee returned with a decision. Most of the faculty felt that graduate education was very important to make Tufts a competitive school, and also felt that the presence of graduate students increased the level of academics on campus. A year later, however, the faculty did decide to vote out the Ph. D. program. It was not reestablished until almost fifty years later. </p>
							<p>In 1909, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was made official, with the administrators from the graduate department continuing in their positions. As of 2001, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences continues to operate in numerous departments at Tufts University. </p>

							<p> Mary Grant Charles (1896-1975), J1920, was the author of travel and historical pieces, short stories, and numerous poems. The Mary Grant Charles Scholarship Prize was donated by her husband and children and is named in her honor.</p>
							<p>Mary Grant Charles was born in Boston and received a B.A. cum laude from Jackson College in 1920 and an M.S. from Simmons College. While at Tufts she was president of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. Before her marriage to Ralph S. Charles, A1923, she worked as a Social Services executive. The family lived in London for three years and moved to Covered Bridge Farm in Potter Place, New Hampshire in 1936.</p>
							<p>Her published works consist of travel and historical pieces, short stories, and numerous poems. Across a Covered Bridge, a collection of about eighty of her poems, was published in 1958. The Lambs of Lanarkshire (Scotland) and their Descendents in America, a regional, historical and genealogical work, was published in 1972. Two other book length works were completed but not published. The first, Born in this House, is a biography of Richard Potter, an internationally acclaimed ventriloquist and magician for whom Potter Place was named. The second, Green Sleeves, is a historical novel set in the nineteenth century around the time of the civil war.</p>
							<p>Mary Grant Charles was elected to the Poetry Society of America in 1951 and is one of only two New Hampshire poets to appear in their Diamond Anthology. She had the privilege of studying poetry under Robert P. Tristram Coffin, who wrote of her as "a fellow poet and a fine one." </p>
							<p>Her two sons also attended Tufts, Grant Charles, A1951 and Ron Charles, A1957. Charles died on April 19, 1975 in New London, New Hampshire. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00423"><head>Gravity Stone, n.d.</head></figure>In 1961 the Gravity Stone or Gravity Monument was placed on the north side of Barnum Hall facing Ballou Hall. The stone's placement on campus was one of the stipulations Roger W. Babson added when he made a sizable donation to Tufts which was meant for research in the field of gravity.</p>
							<p>Mr. Babson was a stock market genius and an enthusiast of the study of gravition. He made several donations to numerous universities with the hopes that the money would advance the study of gravity. His efforts to find institutions of research extended so far that Mr. Babson himself founded three schools, including Babson College. The stone itself is made of solid granite and is estimated to weigh anywhere from 2000 to 3,200 pounds </p>
							<p> Since the stone's arrival in 1961, it has fulfilled more than just an aesthetic role on campus. In years past the stone was more mythical and held a place in on-campus folklore. In 1962 a group of students and employees of Buildings and Grounds tested whether or not the stone itself would defy gravity by digging a large hole underneath the stone. The group observed that even the great Gravity Stone succumbed to the all-powerful forces of which its carvings preach. The group then simply left the stone buried until another group of students and groundskeepers took it upon themselves to dig up the stone and replace it to its original location. Thus began a cycle of burying and digging up the stone which was continued for several years. In 1968 the burying was done yet again, but in this instance the perpetrators were a group of workers building a sidewalk between Barnum and Ballou who buried the stone because it was in the path of their sidewalk. It remained in its secret tomb until 1971 when the Tufts Mountain Club allegedly unearthed the stone by sheer accident the night before commencement. After the infamous fire in Barnum Hall of 1975 the stone was moved to an area behind Cousens Gym. Finally, in 1977 the administration confiscated the stone and removed it to an undisclosed location after an incident where students had blocked the doors of Barnum Hall with the monument as a prank the night before commencement.</p>
							<p>The stone was returned to its current location between Eaton Hall and Goddard Chapel in the early 1980's and has not had any unapproved movements since then. The inscription on the stone reads, "THIS MONUMENT HAS BEEN ERECTED BY THE GRAVITY RESEARCH FOUNDATION. ROGER W. BABSON FOUNDER.IT IS TO REMIND STUDENTS OF THE BLESSINGS FORTHCOMING WHEN A SEMI-INSULATOR IS DISCOVERED IN ORDER TO HARNESS GRAVITY AS A FREE POWER AND REDUCE AIRPLANE ACCIDENTS. 1964" </p>

							<p> Edmund Asbury Gullion (1913-1998), a career diplomat and former ambassador to the Republic of the Congo, served as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy from 1964 to 1978.</p>
							<p>Born the son of a U.S. Major General in Lexington, Kentucky, on March 2, 1913, Gullion was the winner of an international oratorical contest in high school, which was officiated by President Hoover. He spoke on the topic "The Influence of John Marshall on World Affairs." </p>
							<p>After receiving his B.A. in 1935 from Princeton and while teaching in a preparatory school, Gullion took competitive entrance examinations for the Foreign Service. He moved through the grades of the service over the next twenty-five years, serving in various European countries. He was captured by German forces in Salonika, Greece, then was released in an exchange of consular officers. He left Greece to serve as head of a prisoner of war section, among a host of other diplomatic positions in London, Stockholm, and Helsinki.</p>
							<p>In 1946, he was assigned to the Department of State, serving as one of the principle drafters of the Foreign Service Act of 1946, and working on special assignments including atomic energy matters. Gullion attended the National War College in 1948-49 and then became Consul-General of the American Embassy, Saigon, from 1949-1952, which coincided with Indochina's civil war. </p>
							<p>He returned to the State Department as a member of the Policy Planning Staff in September 1952, where he spent the next five years working mainly on disarmament, dependent areas, and new country problems. Gullion was a member of several delegations attending disarmament conferences held in New York and in foreign capitals and served as the State Department's representative on the staff of the President's Adviser on Disarmament. In 1957, Gullion took on the position of foreign service inspector. Three years later he was made Acting Director and Deputy Director of the United States Disarmament Administration. In 1961, he married Patricia Palmer. </p>
							<p>From 1961 to 1964, Gullion served as the Ambassador to the Republic of the Congo. On behalf of his embassy in Leopoldville, Gullion accepted the Department of State's Distinguished Service Award in 1962.He was elected several times to the Electoral Board of the American Foreign Service Association and also served on a Selection Board of the Foreign Service.</p>
							<p>In 1964, Gullion was selected as dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. He led the school for thirteen years, initiating several new programs and furthering the school's globally competitive reputation. The EdwardR. Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy was established during his tenure. While dean of Fletcher in 1972, Gullion was appointed by Nixon to serve on the President's Commission on International Radio Broadcasting.</p>
							<p>In 1971, amid mounting tensions on campus surrounding the conflict in Vietnam, Dean Gullion's office was firebombed to protest Fletcher's ties to the military, causing nearly $70,000 in damage. </p>

							<p>Hairston was born on July 9, 1901 in Belews Creek, North Carolina. His family soon moved to Pennsylvania, and Hairston spent his childhood outside of Pittsburgh. During high school, he worked in a brickyard to earn money for college, finally matriculating at the Massachusetts Agricultural School, now UMASS/Amherst, to study landscape architecture. After one year of schooling, Hairston realized he could not afford to go back. He moved to Boston, and for the next five years, he worked winters hauling coal, and waited tables on a Boston to York passenger boat during the summer. In 1926, Hairston was able to go back to Amherst, and it would be there that his singing talent would change the direction of his life. A local school teacher and choral accompanist named Anna Laura Kidder recognized Hairston's talent, and offered to loan him enough money to complete his education. Hairston applied to Tufts to study music, but was rejected. That summer, he met a 1927 Tufts graduate, who suggested that Hairston meet with Tufts music professor Leo Lewis. Hairston auditioned for Lewis on the front porch of Lewis' Professors Row home, and was immediately accepted to Tufts. After one semester, his singing talent earned him a full scholarship for the rest of his Tufts years.</p>
							<p>After graduating in 1929, Hairston moved to New York City, where he spent two years at Juilliard before entering the workforce. After Juilliard, Hairston joined the Howell Johnson Negro Choir and developed a strong interest in spirituals. Soon, he was assistant director of the choir, and led the group on a trip to Hollywood to search out film roles. After auditioning for a few films, Hairston was hired to arrange the music and conduct the choir for the soundtrack of Dmitri Tiomkin's film "Lost Horizons." This film would jumpstart Hairston's career. He went on to write scores for numerous films, even composing a spiritual for use in the film "Lilies of the Field." In that film, Hairston's dubbed voice can be heard singing his song "Amen" while Sidney Poitier lip synchs. </p>
							<p>Hairston also found success as an actor. For sixteen years, he was the voice of Leroy on Amos 'N' Andy, and he played a native in eight of the ten Tarzan films. Hairston also portrayed Brock Peters' father in "To Kill a Mockingbird," and acted in a number of John Wayne films. Most recently, Hairston appeared in the critically praised film "Being John Malkovich."</p>
							<p>Hairston also gained fame for his work with the African American community. He traveled in the United States directing choirs, and was sent to Europe by the State Department twice, in 1961 and 1963, to instruct foreign groups in performing American folk songs. In 1965, he spent six months in Africa teaching children involved in different choirs. In recognition of his service to the country and to the world, Tufts University presented Hairston with an honorary degree in 1972, and with the Distinguished Service Award in 1990.</p>

							<p>Grandson of the first governor of New Hampshire, Hall was born in Augusta, Maine, on December 15, 1846.He attended the "Little Blue" School for Boys at Farmington and later matriculated at Bowdoin College. He left the school to enlist in the United States Army a few months prior to the end of the Civil War, despite the fact that he was under the age requirement for enlisted soldiers. In 1866, he was asked to be the Assistant Physician at the Lunatic Asylum at Blackwell's Island, New York. Two years later he graduated from Bellevue Hospital Medical College and filled the position of House Physician at the asylum. He held the position for one year, moving on to the position of Assistant Sanitary Inspector in New York City in 1869 and later studying Obstetrics in Vienna for two years. Returning to Canada, Hall established a practice in New Brunswick, later relocating to Newcastle, Maine, and, in 1880, Medford, Massachusetts. </p>
							<p>In 1893, he joined the Tufts College Medical School as the first professor of Theory and Practice of Medicine, a position he held until 1897. Hall was also a member of Medford's Board of Health and a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society. He was married to Jennie A. Failing, with whom he had two children, including Walter Davis Hall, M1898.Hall died following an operation for appendicitis on October 25, 1906.</p>
							<p>The first meeting of the Medical School's faculty was held at Hall's home in Medford in 1893. </p>

Halligan, E1923, H1937, trustee emeritus, and his wife Katherine Halligan. It had been known as the Hooper Laboratories for Electrical Engineering since 1940.</p>
							<p>In 1925, the AMRAD Corporation, which broadcast from a radio tower on the Tufts hillside, built a factory on the former site of Pansy Park. It remained in use until 1930, when AMRAD merged with Motorola and moved their business to the Midwest. Tufts gained control of the property, and the Maintenance Department set up shop inside. </p>
							<p>On June 5, 1940, the building was dedicated as the Hooper Laboratories for Electrical Engineering, in honor of William J. Hooper, A1877, G1878, H1898, a former Tufts professor instrumental in the founding of the Department of Electrical Engineering. The newly renovated building contained large labs, electrical equipment, and a large machine shop. </p>
							<p>In 1983, Hooper Laboratories was renamed Halligan Hall, after a large gift from Halligan and his wife allowed for major renovations in the facility. Between 1983 and 1986, renovations in Halligan split the large labs into smaller, more convenient facilities, shrank the size of the machine shop, and provided new equipment for all the labs. In 1986, the Electro-Optics Technology Center was finished inside Halligan. It contained more labs and office space. </p>
							<p>On October 23, 1994, Halligan Hall was again rededicated. In the previous year, the Department of Computer Science had been moved to Halligan, and the labs were reorganized to include both computer science and electrical engineering equipment. </p>
							<p>In 2000, Halligan Hall continues to serve as home to the Departments of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, as well as offices for the Department of Physical Education/Athletics. </p>

							<p>In 1967, he was inaugurated as President of Tufts University. He is credited with successfully applying his financial planning skills to Tufts' budget. His presidency was marked by episodes of student unrestincluding Vietnam war protests, protests over the presence of army recruiters on campus, and the "Construction Site Crisis" of 1969.The "Construction Site Crisis" occurred when student groups protested the absence of minority workers on dormitory construction crews. Hallowell's adminstration responded to demands for social and educational change by examining and changing the Tufts' curriculum. Committees such as the University Steering Committee, the Committee on Undergraduate Education, and the President's Adminstrative Advisory Group were very active during this time. Hallowell supported the Experimental College and the College Within, both designed to support self-designed programs of study. He resigned as President in 1976, in accordance with his belief that such a position should be held for no longer than a decade. </p>

							<head>Harpswell Laboratory, 1898-1922</head>
							<p> The Harspwell Laboratory, located in South Harpswell, Maine, was established by Tufts in 1898 to offer research opportunities for both undergraduates and professional researchers interested in marine biology. </p>
							<p>In 1898, Professor John Kingsley of the Tufts College Department of Biology decided to start a summer school for biology students on the grounds of his cottage in South Harpswell, Maine. Tufts agreed to sponsor the school, and in 1901 the college paid for the construction of a nine-room laboratory, on Kingsley's property but much closer to the shoreline than his cottage. In the summer of 1902, the Tufts College Summer School of Biology officially opened, offering classes for twenty dollars each. By 1906, however, the school was discontinued and the facility became entirely devoted to research. Researchers from various universities including Colby, Harvard, and Clark traveled to Maine to work at the Harpswell Laboratory. </p>
							<p>In 1913, Tufts cut most of its formal ties with the laboratory and it was established as a scientific corporation under the laws of the State of Maine. This was probably because Professor Kingsley, after a dispute with trustee Austin Fletcher, had resigned his post at Tufts. For the next seven years, however, Tufts continued to support the laboratory, reserving a room for Tufts researchers annually. By 1920, its last year as a research laboratory, Harspwell had provided facilities for over ninety-two researchers, who in turn published a total of more than one hundred and ten papers. </p>
							<p>The financial drain of World War I, however, proved too much for the laboratory. In 1920, after it became clear that there was no more room or funds for expansion on the Harpswell property, the laboratory and moved. "The Wild Gardens of Acadia" Corporation, of which Harpswell Laboratory was a member, offered the lab new facilities on Mt. Desert Island, Maine, in return for a name change. In 1922, Harpswell Laboratory changed its name to Mt. Desert Island Laboratory and moved to its new home. Tufts attempted to keep its connection with the lab, offering the laboratory trustees the deed to the Harpswell property in return for a permanent room in the new facility, but was denied. The laboratory trustees did not want to be permanently affiliated with any university, and returned the Harpswell deed to Tufts. In 1922, all ties between Tufts and the Harpswell Laboratory were severed. </p>
							<p>Tufts eventually sold the Harpswell property. Novelist Edith Dorian purchased the Kingsley cabin, while the laboratory was purchased and renovated by Guy Coolidge. The Coolidge property burned to the ground in the early 1960's. </p>

							<p>Harry Adams Hersey was born on April 22, 1870, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Before entering Tufts as a freshman in 1899, Mr. Hersey had already made a living for himself as a piano tuner and a partner in a music store. He completed his bachelors degree in 1903, and continued on at Tufts, receiving a bachelor of divinity and master of arts in 1906. He was ordained at Goddard Chapel in 1906.Hersey went on to serve as a pastor in several cities in both Connecticut and Massachusetts for eighteen years. During that time he also served as secretary for the New Haven Universalist Church and was on the Danbury Board of Education for eight years. He was an enthusiastic cyclist and lifelong supporter of Tufts. </p>
							<p>Although he remained a dedicated alumnus by serving as a recruitment officer for Tufts in Danbury, Connecticut, his most notable donation to the Tufts community was in his capacity as a writer. Mr. Hersey's love of both music and Tufts compelled him to write a historical work which chronicled the history of music at Tufts from 1856 to 1945.After extensive correspondence between himself and the Tufts record keepers, and through his own research, Mr. Hersey was able to chronicle and list the musical organizations, programs, notable teachers, performances, and other related information into his book. In addition, Mr. Hersey included biographical sketches of some of the most influential members of the Tufts musical community, such as Leo R. Lewis, whom Mr. Hersey attributes with truly allowing the Tufts musical program to blossom. After seven years of diligent work, Hersey completed The History of Music at Tufts College, which the trustees then agreed to publish at the university's expense.</p>
							<p>In appreciation for both his historical and recruitment efforts on behalf of Tufts, Hersey was awarded an honorary doctor of divinity degree in 1940 and the alumni distinguished service key in 1948.Mr. Hersey died on October 11, 1951, at his home in Somerville, Massachusetts, at the age of eighty years old.</p>
							<p>Hersey sent two sons, a daughter, and a grandson to Tufts, and a third son was a teaching fellow in English. </p>

							<head>Holmes, John A., 1904-1962</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS007:MS007.010.DO.00157"><head>John Holmes, January 6, 1946</head></figure>John Albert Holmes Jr. (1904-1962) was born in Somerville, Massachusetts, on January 6, 1904 to John Holmes, Sr., an engineer, and Mary (Murdock) Holmes. After attending Somerville public schools, John Holmes entered Tufts College in the fall of 1925. John Cousens, president of Tufts University, heard Holmes read the class poem at his high school graduation, and, impressed with the young poet, took Holmes under his wing during Holmes' student years at Tufts. Holmes received his bachelor's degree in 1929 and throughout the following year attended graduate courses at Harvard while serving as an assistant in English at Tufts. </p>
							<p>Holmes began his teaching career at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he served as an instructor of English during the years 1930-32. He later returned to Somerville and Tufts, joining the faculty of the Department of English as an instructor in 1934. At Tufts, he advanced through the ranks of assistant and associate to a full professorship in 1960. He was honored with an honorary doctorate by the university in 1962. </p>
							<p>Holmes achieved notable success as a poet and author during his lifetime. He published seven collections of poetry: Address to the Living (1937), Fair Warning (1939), Map of My Country (1943), Along the Row (1944), The Double Root (1950), The Symbols (1955), and The Fortune Teller (1961). His work appeared in numerous publications from literary journals to daily newspapers. Holmes wrote two books about the writing of poetry, The Poet's Work (1939) and Writing Poetry (1960), in addition to many essays and book reviews. Holmes was also an avid letter-writer, and had active correspondence with family, friends, and other poets. Letter-writing was part of his daily writing routine, and served as a warm-up of sorts for the work of writing verse. </p>
							<p>Holmes devoted considerable effort to fostering the development of young and budding poets with whom he came into contact. In addition to teaching poetry and creative writing at Tufts, he taught poetry workshops at the Boston Center for Adult Education, and directed or participated in writers' workshops at Tufts University, the University of New Hampshire at Durham, and the Chautauqua Writers' conference. Holmes also hosted an informal poetry circle among other Boston-area poets in the 1950s, a group which included May Sarton, Anne Sexton, and others. This group met regularly at Holmes' residence in Medford to read and comment on each others' work. </p>
							<p>In 1933, Holmes married his first wife, Sara Frances Ludlow, with whom he had one son, John Ludlow Holmes. After his first wife's death, he married Doris Kirk in 1948 and had another son, Evan Kirk Holmes, and daughter, Margaret Nash Holmes. Holmes died June 22, 1962 following a long illness in Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.</p>
							<p>Following Holmes' death, his papers including manuscripts of almost 1,000 poems were given to the University Archives. </p>

							<head>Homecoming, 1925</head>
							<p> Homecoming Day was established at Tufts in 1925 after an informal reunion of alumni following a Tufts football game versus Middlebury. </p>
							<p>On November 7, 1925, a number of alumni returned to campus to watch the Tufts football team take on Middlebury. After the game, many alumni attended a social program set up by the Association of Tufts Alumni. By the next year, Homecoming Day had become an established tradition.</p>
							<p>For the first couple of years, Middlebury remained Tufts' rival on Homecoming Day. By the late 1920s, however, Homecoming did not feature a traditional rival. In fact, it wasn't until the late 1980s that Tufts' Homecoming rivalries were firmly established. Since that time, Williams and Amherst have come to Tufts every other year, and served as Tufts' rivals during Homecoming games.</p>
							<p>Although the football games have always been the central attraction on Homecoming Day, different groups host a number of parties, barbecues, and other events throughout the weekend. At early Homecomings, the Tufts Boston Club held a smoker in the afternoon, after the end of the football game. This smoker was then followed by an annual alumni supper. </p>
							<p>One of the most visible events of Homecoming Day is the annual spirit parade. Various fraternities and student organizations build floats and parade down Professor's Row, vying for the title of best float. Also, the day before Homecoming Day, the Inter-Greek Council sponsors an annual block party on Fletcher Field. The block party usually includes a live band along with different activities and games. Fraternities also hold various barbecues for alumni members. Homecoming Day is also marked by the annual creation of Tailgater's Village in the parking lot adjacent to the Ellis Oval. Cars are allowed to park all day, and many students and alumni barbecue and celebrate in the parking lot.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, Homecoming Day remains one of Tufts' strongest traditions, attracting many alumni each year. </p>

							<p>After Professor Hooper's death, the house continued to serve as a residence for his sister. She rented rooms to a number of faculty members, including Professor Robert C. Givler, Professor George P. Bacon, Mr. H.L. Etheridge, and Mr. D.D. Sample, manager of the bookstore from 1928 to 1932.</p>
							<p>In 1933 the house was purchased by Tufts to serve as the headquarters for the Department of Education. It was used for this purpose until 1949.</p>
							<p>In 1949, the house was converted to serve as the infirmary for men, and was expanded to serve the needs of women students in 1956. At this time the house became known as Hooper Infirmary.</p>

Houston (1892-1965), A1914, affectionately known as "Pop" to generations of Tufts men and women, served the college as faculty member, department chair, director of the Second Century Fund, and as Tufts' first Vice President for Development. </p>
							<p>"Pop" Houston was born on a small ranch near Virgil, South Dakota, in 1892.His family moved to Methuen, Massachusetts, when he was seven years old. In preparation for his entrance into Tufts, Houston attended Dean Academy for one year. He distinguished himself as a fullback and guard for the Tufts football team from 1910 until he graduated in 1914.He then assumed the position of teacher and director of athletics in Adirondack, Florida, before serving as an officer in World War I.He received machine gun injuries that left him the hospital for eight months and plagued him throughout his lifetime. After the war, he obtained a law degree from Northeastern University and practiced with the Boston firm of Russell, Pugh, and Joslin. </p>

After graduate school, he was a NATO postdoctoral fellow at the Clarendon Laboratory in Oxford. He was appointed assistant professor of Physics at Tufts University in 1967, and promoted to professor in 1981. He held many additional appointments such as on the Executive Committee of the Instrument and Measurement Sciences Group of the American Physical Society, visiting scientist at the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory at M.I.T., and chairman of the GTE Laboratories Academic Advisory Council, directing their Undergraduate Research Projects program. He served on many university committees, including the Committee on Academic Awards, of which he was chairman from 1987 to 1990.</p>
							<p>His research was on solids at cryogenic temperatures and in high magnetic fields. His colleagues appreciated his deft touch with instruments and hardware and his remarkable ability to spot and solve problems that always occur in complex experiments. Any group with which he worked came to depend on his constant good humor, especially during difficult moments. His publications are extensive. He was widely admired as a popular and enthusiastic teacher. Student evaluations included such statements as "he used an enthusiastic approach to physics," and "he was one of the best professors that I had at Tufts."</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00410"><head>James D. Hume, 1995</head></figure>James David Hume (1923-1995) was chair of the Department of Geology. His research on the geology of the Alaskan coast served as the foundation for interpretive investigation of modern Arctic shorelines andt hei analogues in the more widespread Arctic environments of the Pleistocene.</p>
							<p>James David Hume was born in Fresno, California, December 17, 1923, near the family logging town of Hume. He grew up in Michigan. After graduating from West Point in 1945, he earned three degrees from the University of Michigan (B.S.E. in civil engineering, 1949; M.S., 1950; Ph. D., 1957). There he met his future wife and active partner, Patricia Wright, and married her in 1954. He taught at Purdue from 1955 to 1957. He then came to Tufts where he shared his love for the earth and the art and science of geology with his students. At the time, geology was a two-man department in the Barnum Museum. When the department moved to Lane Hall, he designed and equipped a first-class facility there.</p>
							<p>His teaching style was low-key, but it was evident that he cared for his subject, the world he lived in, and above all, for his students. He was securely grounded in the classical foundations of geology and was aware of important new ideas, to which he consistently introduced his students. Thus he introduced the paradigm of plate tectonics soon after it emerged in the 1960, but not as a dogmatic preamble. In his course it was a capstone to an examination both of the evidence on which it is based and the variety of phenomena to which it provides a unifying theorem.</p>
							<p>His methodical analyses of process, products, and form along the Arctic coast near Point Barrow, Alaska, through ten years stand almost alone in the literature of the western world. They serve as a baseline for interpretive investigations in both modern Arctic shorelines and their analogues in the more widespread Arctic environments of the Pleistocene.</p>
							<p>In Londonderry, New Hampshire, he joined the Planning Board and ensured that land-use zoning was consistent with ground-water protection. He helped strengthen local efforts to manage development and minimize pollution at Pleasant Lake. He later worked with his wife on the reconstruction of past environments of archaeological sites she was investigating. He died in 1995. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.011.DO.01000"><head>Hurricane damage to Ballou Hall, 1938</head></figure>On September 21, 1938, the first hurricane recorded in the history of the weather bureau in New England struck the northeast, causing over one hundred deaths and over $100,000,000 of property damage in Massachusetts alone. At Tufts, although trees and power lines went down across campus, no one was injured and no major damage was reported to any buildings. </p>
							<p>"The Big Wind," as it was nicknamed, hit New England with almost no warning. Two days prior, all signs had pointed to the hurricane going ashore in Florida, and many homeowners across the South had already begun boarding their windows and hunkering down for the storm. On September 19, however, the storm moved between two high-pressure areas and began to race northwards. Not expecting a storm of such magnitude, New Englanders did not prepare themselves adequately. When winds began to pick up during the afternoon of September 21, many people were out running errands and going about their everyday business. Many of the deaths blamed on the storm occurred when a fifteen foot tidal wave struck the coastline of Massachusetts and Rhode Island right as schools were letting out for the day. </p>
							<p>The Somerville area, luckily out of range of the abnormally high tides and the tidal wave, was battered by winds topping one hundred miles per hour. Trees were blown over, power lines snapped, and the entire roof of St. Joseph's Church in Somerville was blown off. </p>
							<p>At Tufts, the winds started to pick up immediately following a faculty meeting concerning the arrival of pre-registration students, planned to begin on September 24. Professors reported feeling increasing winds as they made their way home, and soon after began to witness the destructive power of the storm. Some professors worked quickly to brace trees, while others attempted to film and photograph the storm. The first trees to collapse in the wind were those on the golf course. The heavy winds simply uprooted the trees, leaving them lying on their sides, roots in the air. </p>
							<p>The next morning, after the winds had died down and the damage could be inspected, it was determined that a total of sixty-three trees had been lost in the storm. Along with the trees, a number of power lines had come down, either because of the falling trees or because the poles holding up the lines had snapped in half. The tree damage was especially heavy on the Academic Quad, where fallen trees completely blocked the path from Ballou to Packard. Trees also littered the quad in front of <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> and behind the Goddard chapel. Incredibly, not one falling tree damaged any Tufts building. </p>
							<p>Over the next few days, a massive cleanup operation began. Using a steam shovel already on campus for construction use, university workers dug out the uprooted trees and hauled the remains off of the campus in large trucks. The Edison Malden Electric Company, along with Tufts Professor Crabtree and others, helped to restore power to the university. After matriculation, even students joined the effort. A large group of freshmen worked for an entire Saturday removing debris from the top of the hill. </p>
							<p>Within a few weeks, the campus was clean of debris, and power had been restored to all buildings. Although the storm left its mark by destroying so many trees, Tufts was able to escape the hurricane almost unscathed. </p>

His book, Economic Elements of the Pax Britannica, was a standard text in the field.</p>
							<p>Albert Henry Imlah was born January 30, 1901 in British Columbia into a Scotch-Canadian family. He graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1922, and received a master's degree from Clark University in Massachusetts. After teaching History at the University of Maine he joined Tufts in 1927, where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1931, he completed his doctorate at Harvard. The thesis was published by Harvard University Press in 1939, and his Economic Elements of the Pax Britannica appeared in 1958. He became professor in 1935, adjunct professor of diplomatic history at the Fletcher School in 1944, and received an honorary degree in 1981, to honor his many years of excellence in teaching, impeccable scholarship, and leadership in academic affairs. He served as chair of the Department of History from 1956 to 1965.</p>
							<p>He worked actively within the American Association of University Professors for the increase of faculty salaries. In 1954, having just become a widower, he was visited by a representative of the Ford Foundation to discuss faculty salary data. As the discussion reached the supper hour Imlah, hungry yet eager to continue the conversation, invited the visitor home for supper, but found only some leftover meatloaf and very woody carrots from the back garden. There has been speculation that this supper rather than the salary data persuaded the foundation to begin a funding program for faculty salaries.</p>

							<p>Ivan Galantic was born and raised in Croatia. He was jailed by Italy's fascist government which occupied his country at the onset of World War II. Emerging from a concentration camp eager to resume serious study, he attended the University of Rome, and then the Academy of Fine Arts, earning an M.F.A. As a young painter, he received numerous awards and was invited to join a prestigious art academy in Spain. Instead, he accepted a UNESCO-sponsored fellowship for study in Florence.</p>
							<p>He eventually emigrated to the United States, where he painted, exhibited, and taught studio art. He recalls taking a good look in the mirror one day and asking himself, "Do I want to continue on my own artistic path, or do I want to look at and study what I see in the greatest artists-the Rembrandts, Michelangelos and the rest?" He specialized in Italian Renaissance Art and earned a Ph. D. at Harvard. He taught at Tufts University and the Harvard Extension School. Now professor emeritus at Tufts, he continues, after twenty-seven years, to teach History of Art at Harvard.</p>

							<head>Ivy Book, 1902-1971</head>
							<p> The Ivy Book was published by the Ivy Society, which was the sophmore honor society and designated keeper of campus traditions. It appeared each academic year from 1902 to 1970, encompassing all academic years through 1971, with the exception of 1943-44 and 1944-45 when the number of students was diminished due to World War II. Its purpose was to serve as the official guide for all aspects of student life, act as a source of general campus knowledge, while providing a directory of people and places on campus.</p>
							<p>The book's format in 1902 contained the college calendar, college policies, listings of fraternities, sororities, and student organizations, campus cheers and songs, athletics schedules and a listing of campus and freshman traditions. This structure remained in effect, varying only slightly, during the publication's entire existence. Pocket-sized, the Ivy Book was required to be carried by first year Tufts students at all times, ensuring its use as a reference for life on the Hill.</p>
							<p>The Ivy Book ceased publication when the Ivy Society disbanded in 1971.The functions the publication served were partially assumed by the Dean of Students Office with its 1971 publication of the Student Handbook, the precursor to the Pachyderm. </p>

							<p>The Ivy Society was formulated to foster class spirit in the junior class as well as to do away with "factional feeling which may exist on the Hill," though these two goals were somewhat contradictory. For many years the Ivy Society's main activity was the preparation and production of the Ivy Book, a handbook for the college, which became an essential publication for incoming students from its first appearance in the 1902-03 academic year. It was an annual publication which ceased in 1971.</p>
							<p>The duties assigned to the Ivy Society by the student council were to publish the Ivy Book, to run dances after basketball games, to have charge of Junior Day and Junior Prom, to run organized football trips, to act as ushers at formal Chapel functions, to look after athletic trophies, to gather together the pictures of the current athletic teams, and to conduct Senior and Freshman elections, including the counting of votes.</p>
							<p>Election to the society at first was by vote of the faculty, but after the first class was elected, election was by the membership of the society, who selected the following year's members from the Junior class. During the academic year 1923-24, there was criticism as some felt that fraternity politics and popularity had undue weight in the selection process. A revision of the rules in 1929-30 changed the process and from that time forward the society nominated qualified members of the rising class, and the class as a whole voted to elect members of the society.</p>
							<p>The last elections for the society were held in April 1969 for the 1969-70 academic year. </p>

							<head>Jackson Baseball, ca. 1920-32</head>
							<p>The 1920s were a period of expansion and excitement for women's baseball nationally as well as at Tufts. Teams of 'Bloomer Girls' barnstormed across the country, challenging local and minor league men's teams to contests, which they invariably won. The women were highly successful and laid the groundwork for the All-American Girls Baseball League during World War II.As successful as the 'bloomer girls' were, so were the Jackson women. The Tufts Weekly, among others, boasted that the Jackson gals could play ball just as well as the men.</p>
							<p>The first organized baseball games played by Jackson women occurred during spring field days beginning around 1914 up through 1923.1923 also saw the first inter-house games between the separate dormitories (and the Off-Hill girls) on campus. Graves House, captained by Roselyn Bray, won a thrilling 13-8 victory over the Off-Hill girls to capture the inter-house title.</p>
							<p>Alongside the inter-house games began a new tradition - the pitting of classes against the other. In May 1928 the sophomores put together an eleven run first inning on their way to beating up on the poor freshmen.</p>
							<p>The next year, Tufts organized its first girl's varsity, losing two games to Pembroke. The team would last only four years and compete solely against Pembroke, for no other schools in the area supported a women's baseball team. In the final game, the Jackson nine defeated their rivals in a closely contested battle, 27-26.Mirroring the demise of the bloomer girls, women's baseball at Tufts disappeared during the middle 1930's as popular sentiment shifted towards disapproval of women in baseball.</p>
							<p>Presumably, one area of concern lay with a suggestive practice adopted by the Jackson women. Rather than place a standing catcher well behind the batter, the Jackson catcher squatted, as the men did, directly behind home plate. This provocative posture apparently did not sit well with contemporaries. Though evidence is lacking, it appears that the Jackson players were among the first to adopt the posture.</p>

							<head>Jackson College, 1904</head>
							<p> Named after Cornelia Maria Jackson, who bequeathed funds to Tufts to help "remove the disabilities of women," Jackson College was founded in 1910 as a coordinate college to Tufts. An alternative to both women's colleges and fully coeducational schools, coordinate colleges provided women with a spearate, and supposedly equal, education at a women's college that existed in conjunction with a men's school.</p>
							<p>Women were first admitted to Tufts College in 1892, some forty years after the college's founding, and their presence was a continual source of debate among the faculty, administration, and Trustees. As an alternative to coeducation, President Frederick Hamilton, himself an opponent of coeducation, argued for the establishment of a separate, coordinate college. This compromise resulted in the establishment of Jackson College. Caroline Davies, the first woman to serve on the Tufts faculty, and the first female administrative officer, was named as the first dean. </p>
							<p>Segregated instruction lasted only a few years, and by the time the catalogue for 1913 was published all mention of separate classes for women was gone. From 1917 to 1963 women graduates received Tufts degrees only. Since 1963, women's diplomas carry an identification of Jackson College.</p>
							<p>Socially, however, the concept of Jackson College remained strong until the 1970s. Jackson College had its own student government, clubs, and other student organizations. The Jumbo, the undergraduate college yearbook revived in 1917, had separate sections for Tufts College and Jackson College through the 1960s.</p>
							<p>Although no longer a separate part of the university, Jackson College is still a legal entity and the title of the undergraduate division of the university remains the College of Liberal Arts and Jackson College. </p>

							<head>Jackson, Cornelia Maria, 1822-1895</head>
							<p> Cornelia Maria Jackson (1822-95) was an advocate of women's rights, a committed Universalist, and a benefactor of Tufts University. Her generous gift allowed for the establishment of the Cornelia M. Jackson College for Women in 1910.</p>
							<p>The daughter of John and Nancy Fuller, Jackson was born in Wrentham, Massachusetts, on December 15, 1822. She attended Attleboro Academy and went on to Bridgewater State Normal School. After graduating in 1847, Jackson taught school in Wrentham, Mansfield, and Attleboro. Albert J. Metcalf, another prominent figure in the establishment and support of Tufts College was one of her pupils. In 1862, she married Sylvester R. Jackson, a Providence businessman. Jackson relocated to Rhode Island, where she resided for the rest of her life. Her only child, Mary, died suddenly in 1892, and her husband died the following year. She died in 1895, within two years of her husband's death. </p>
							<p>Although not well-known outside of Providence, Jackson was a life-long believer in equal rights for women, enthusiastically advocating suffrage and access to higher education for women. Jackson was a member of the Church of the Mediator, a Universalist congregation located in Providence and led by Rev. Dr. Henry W. Rugg, a friend of hers for more than twenty-five years. The pastor was a member of the Tufts College Corporation, for which he served as secretary. He also had sat on the committee that voted to open Tufts doors to women students in 1892.</p>
							<p>Jackson showed much interest in Tufts' move to coeducation and bequeathed the College $70,000 and half of the remainder of her estate to Tufts. As she states in her will, Jackson's gift was "In great thankfulness for the opportunity now opening before me, which realizes the dream of my youth, and which has grown to a hope with advancing years; that of helping to remove the disabilities of women..."The bequest was to be used for the establishment of a building to be designated as "The Cornelia M. Jackson College for Women" and for the provision of special instruction for women "in the duties and privileges of American citizenship, and in the theory and working of the United States government," for which a chair in Political Science was endowed in 1898.</p>
							<p>Jackson did not, however, endorse the creation of a sexually segregated learning environment within her will. When the women were separated from the men's college in 1910, it was felt that the name "Jackson College" continued to be a fitting one and did not at all diminish the significance of Jackson's memorial offering.</p>
							<p>Jackson College and the Cornelia M. Jackson Chair of Political Science were both named in her honor in gratitude for her generosity to Tufts. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.011.DO.01019"><head>The Jam, ca. 1920</head></figure>The Jam, or Jamming, was an undergraduate tradition begun as early as 1905. It was part of the annual banquet season, during which the freshman and sophomore classes each held banquets as a way of celebrating class spirit. Jamming involved kidnapping members of the other class to prevent attendance at its banquet, thereby preventing the success of that class's banquet. Jams and the banquets associated with them were part of a complex tradition of freshman-sophomore class rivalry, which culminated in an annual football game between the two classes during which the class that had amassed the most points in the various informal competitions was able to demonstrate its greater class spirit through the display of its class flags.</p>
							<p>The banquets were a competitive event moderated by Sword and Shield, the sophomore honor society and designated keeper of Tufts traditions. In order to hold a successful banquet, each class would have to comply with criteria set by Sword and Shield governing attendance, such as that a certain percentage of the class had to attend, or particular officeholders had to be present. Failure to meet these criteria meant that the banquet was declared to have "fizzled" and that class bore the stigma of failing to demonstrate proper spirit.</p>
							<p>Jamming began when members of one class would kidnap their counterparts in the other class to prevent their attendance at the banquet, in order to cause the other class's banquet to fail. Victims would be ambushed, tackled, and hog-tied, usually with a jump rope, and then held until after the banquet had begun, threatening its success.</p>
							<p>Though criteria governing successful banquets were set by Sword and Shield, the events and associated Jams were policed by Tower Cross, the senior honor society.</p>
							<p>If the freshman class won, the rule requiring wearing of class beanies was suspended temporarily. If the sophomores won, freshman were forced to wear their beanies inside out on designated days, as a mark of their failure. </p>
							<p>The Tufts Weekly continued to record kidnapping incidents through the 1930s. By 1947, many of the freshman traditions and practices had become obsolete, and in 1952, Sword and Shield moved to eliminate several of the traditions, including most freshman-oriented hazing activities. </p>

This award is given by the Department of Drama and Dance for excellence in directing and/or stage management, as demonstrated during the student's career in the university theater.</p>
							<p>Jane Anne Herman-Newton graduated from Tufts in 1987 with a major in English. She was very active in the Department of Drama and had a natural gift for directing and stage management. In 1999, an award in her memory was established by her friends to recognize students with these same talents. Jane's honesty and friendship touched many people in her life. At Tufts, Jane created strong bonds. She shared her views, humor, and love and made friends feel connected and valued. She had a flair for both theater and organization, the cornerstones of directing and stage management. She planned her wedding (with Goddard Chaplain Scotty McClennan presiding) while finishing her M.A. at Harvard and had a version of A Midsummer Night's Dream performed for the wedding guests in Harvard Yard. Most of the actors were Tufts alums. When Jane was completing her doctorate at Harvard, she had many occasions to bring friends together. At Thanksgiving, Canadian Thanksgiving, and Passover, Jane invited friends who were far from home, and friends looking for community and laughter. Jane and her husband, Chris Newton, G1995, prepared big family meals, after which the guests would play games. The award in her name is given to celebrate Jane's creativity, adventurousness, and openness.</p>

Human Nutrition Research Center, designed by architects Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson, and Abbott, opened in 1982. The building, a joint project of Tufts and the United States Department of Agriculture, was constructed to house facilities for a variety of programs dedicated to research in nutrition, health, and aging. It was named in honor of Tufts president and renowned nutritionist, Jean Mayer. </p>
							<p>The groundbreaking for the $32 million project took place in December 1979, after the Department of Agriculture granted Tufts funding to begin construction. At the time, the building was the first and largest nutritional research center in the country. The building was constructed to house research facilities to determine what role nutrition plays in the aging process, and what nutrient requirements are optimal for a healthy and vigorous lifespan. </p>
							<p>Completed in 1982, the fifteen-story building contains clinical research facilities, special kitchen and dining facilities, outpatient facilities for local community studies, a 230-seat auditorium, offices, seminar rooms, and a large library. The third and fourth floors of the building contain animal quarters with advanced environmental control systems. These quarters are capable of holding up to 15,000 small animals. The center also contains living facilities for up to twenty-eight volunteers participating in long term studies. </p>
							<p>As of 2001, the Jean Mayer U.S.D.A. Human Nutrition Research Center, located at the corner of Washington and Stuart Streets in Boston, continues to house the facilities of the joint research projects. It provides research facilities for up to fifty scientists and over one hundred and fifty staff members. </p>

The HNRC is operated by Tufts University under the authority of the USDA as a government-owned, contractor-operated facility. The HNRC, situated in downtown Boston on the Tufts Health Sciences campus, opened officially in November 1982. </p>
							<p>The mission of the HNRC is to examine the relationship between nutrition and aging, and it was the first research center in the world to have that specific focus. Research at the center aims to suggest ways in which diet, alone and in association with other factors, can delay or prevent the onset of degenerative conditions associated with the aging process.</p>
							<p>The HNRC was founded through the advocacy of Jean Mayer, Tufts president and renowned nutritionist. The center's placement in New England was chosen because the large population of older citizens, the variety of ethnic and economic groups, and its urban/rural character make it a microcosm of the US as a whole.</p>
							<p>The HNRC is located on the corner of Stuart and Washington Streets on the Boston campus in a building constructed to house the center in 1982.The building was designed by Shepley, Bulfinch, Richardson, and Abbott, and was dedicated in November 5, 1982.Prior to that time the center's activities were housed elsewhere on the Boston campus. </p>

She graduated from the University of Missouri in 1927, receiving her Master of Arts degree in Zoology from her alma mater the following year. Jeffers then studied as a Bryn Mawr Traveling Fellow at the University of Berlin, Germany for a year. In 1932, she obtained a Ph. D. in Biology and Biochemistry from Bryn Mawr. Jeffers also held a year-long National Research Council fellowship at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, in 1933.</p>
							<p>Teaching zoology, Jeffers joined the faculty of University of Missouri, later moving on to Duke University, where she was an assistant professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy.

This prize was established in 1990 in memory of Joanne Mary Sullivan, who held a B.A. in psychology, by her parents Eugene and Vilma, her brother Eugene Jr., G1990, and family and friends. </p>
							<p>Joanne Mary Sullivan was born on December 28, 1962. She was a red-headed dynamo who loved life and people. She had been a Girl Scout who earned the highest award given to girls in scouting, the Marian Medal. She enjoyed photography and with friends from her photography classes would shoot the architecture of Boston and vicinity, running the gamut from early morning with sunrise lighting to the somber photographs of late evening.</p>
							<p>After graduating from St. Clement High School in 1980, she entered Boston State College. When that school was absorbed by the University of Massachusetts during the semester break of her sophomore year, she continued on despite the challenge presented when students transferring from B.S.C. were not allowed to take classes for which they had preregistered. She earned a B.A. in psychology from UMass through sheer perseverance. While attending school full time, she worked forty hours a week at a mental health clinic to help pay her tuition.</p>
							<p>She was applying to graduate schools in 1987 when she died accidentally. She was just 24. After her death, friends held a gallery showing of her photography to help fund a scholarship in her name. With additional help from family and friends, in 1990 a prize fund was established in the Department of Psychology at Tufts. Her mother, Vilma has worked in Tufts Office of Publications since 1977, and her brother, Eugene, G1990, received a master of science degree in electrical engineering from Tufts.</p>

							<p> The John Baronian Field House was built over the existing field house in 1986 to upgrade the athletics facilities at the Medford Campus Ellis Oval. It was named after John Baronian, A1950, a trustee, founder of the Tufts Jumbo Club, and president of the Tufts Alumni Association from 1972 to 1982. While at Tufts, Baronian was an all-star linebacker for the football team.</p>
							<p>The original field house was built around 1885 when university officials decided to build an athletic field on the current site of the Ellis Oval. The field house was burnt down by vandals soon after its completion, but was replaced in the early 1920's by a surplus barrack used by soldiers during World War One. The barrack was renovated to include locker room facilities for men's sports, and showers were added so that athletes would not have to trek to the gym after sporting events. </p>
							<p>By the middle of the 1980s, the field house was beginning to fall apart, and was not large enough to house facilities for both men's and women's teams. There was no room for game officials, and the showers and toilets often did not work.</p>
							<p>The new facility, which cost $850,000, included two large locker rooms and two smaller ones, men's and women's shower and bathroom facilities, a meeting room, a game official room, and a small first aid center. Bond Brothers of Somerville handled all of the construction, which was initiated with a groundbreaking ceremony that included the detonation of a buried charge of dynamite by Baronian and Tufts president Jean Mayer.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, the Baronian Field House still functions as a locker room facility for both male and female athletic teams competing at Ellis Oval and nearby athletic fields. </p>

He set a world record in the same event in 1960.Following his graduation in 1956, Johnson became a National Honor Scholar at the University of Chicago Law School. He continued to race, winning a gold medal with the U.S. 400-meter relay team in the Pan American Games. Johnson was also selected as an All-American sprinter.</p>
							<p>In 1964, Johnson went to Washington, DC as a program officer for the Governmental Affairs Institute. He continued his training at American University, organizing its Track Club and inspiring dozens of students to excel at track and field activities. In 1969, he taught modern history at St. Albans School for Boys, while coaching the school's track team, feeling he was making "an emotional investment" in helping black athletes obtain a college education.</p>
							<p>Johnson moved to Stanford University in 1979, to assume the position of varsity track coach and director of track and field for both men and women. In 1984, he coached the U.S. Summer Olympics women's track team, which earned fifteen medals during sixteen events, including seven gold.</p>
							<p>At Tufts Homecoming 1985, Johnson was presented with the Tufts Presidential Medal for service both to his alma mater and the larger community, illustrated by his goal "not to make track champions but to develop human beings."He had coached more than forty Olympic athletes during the course of his career. In 1987, Johnson was made manager of Sports Programming (Track &amp; Field) for Walt Disney World Sports in Orlando, Florida. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02877"><head>Jumbo, with a painting of P.T. Barnum hanging over Barnum's desk in the background, 1949</head></figure>Jumbo was a male African elephant owned by P.T. Barnum, Tufts trustee and benefactor, and is mascot of Tufts University. Jumbo was the largest elephant known at the time, standing approximately twelve feet tall at the shoulder and weighing more than six tons. Though Jumbo never visited the campus during his lifetime, Barnum donated Jumbo's stuffed hide to the college.</p>
							<p>Jumbo was still a baby when captured by a party of traders in Abyssinia in 1861.He was sold to a wild animal collector, Johann Schmidt, who, in turn, sold the elephant to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. Jumbo remained in Paris for three years with another elephant, Alice. In 1865, Matthew Scott, who was to serve as Jumbo's keeper for the rest of the elephant's life, came to see the two young elephants, who were ill. Scott believed that they could be cured, and arranged to acquire them for the London Zoological Gardens in exchange for a rhinoceros. Under Scott's care they were returned to health and Jumbo especially became a favorite of visitors to the London Zoo. </p>
							<p>Barnum purchased Jumbo in 1882 for $10,000 from the Royal Zoological Society in London. After a great protest in England, including from Queen Victoria, he brought Jumbo to America. Barnum took Jumbo on tour with his circus for the next several years. Jumbo traveled on a specially constructed rail car that was large enough to hold him.</p>
							<p>In 1885, Jumbo was killed by a train in St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada. The accident took place when Jumbo and Tom Thumb, a dwarf elephant, were being led across the train yard by their keeper when a train came down a little-used track and struck Jumbo. According to legend, spread by Barnum, Jumbo pushed Tom Thumb out of the path of the oncoming train, saving his life, and reached out his trunk to his keeper, Matthew Scott, before dying. An eyewitness report by Edgar H. Flach, who claimed to have seen the entire event, reported rather that Jumbo fled the train when his keeper realized the danger and directed him to run. In his fear, Jumbo missed the opening in the fence that would have enabled him to leave the track and was unable to escape the oncoming train. While Jumbo's heroism in saving Tom Thumb does not appear to be true, Flack confirms that Jumbo did clasp his trainer in his trunk before dying.</p>
							<p>Barnum had Jumbo's skeleton and hide saved and mounted separately. The hide was stuffed by Carl Ackeley and William Critchley. Stuffed Jumbo continued to tour with the circus until 1889, when he was given to Tufts to be displayed in the Barnum Museum of Natural History. Barnum hoped that the stuffed elephant would provide publicity useful to the college. Jumbo's bones were mounted and given to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where they were on display for many years.</p>
							<p>Jumbo became the college mascot in 1889, when he was given to Tufts. In addition to giving his name to Tufts' athletic teams, Jumbo was believed to give good luck. Before big exams or games, students would tug on his tail or put pennies in his trunk to ensure a good outcome. All of the tail-tugging took its toll, however, and his tail was replaced in 1952, when stuffed Jumbo underwent repairs. The original tail that was removed was packed up with other historical materials in the Library, and is held in the University Archives.</p>
							<p>Jumbo was housed in the Barnum Museum until 1975, when much of the building and its contents, including Jumbo, were destroyed by fire. The next day, a member of the Department of Athletics salvaged ashes from the site where Jumbo had stood, and the jar of ashes continues to serve as a good luck charm for Tufts athletics teams. </p>

							<head>Kursaal, 1940-84</head>
							<p>In 2002 many students enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of Brown and Brew. What many of them do not know is that at one time in the basement of Curtis Hall dwelt a predecessor: the much beloved hangout called Kursaal.</p>
							<p>According to former Tufts President Leonard Carmichael, the eatery/refreshment stand was named after a term used in Switzerland and European resorts to describe a pump room or casino. The President thought it was a good name for a place "where students might 'take the cure' after the rigors of hard study."Later students, unaware of the origins of the name, believed it stood for a shortening of Curtis Hall, or was derived from an African phrase.</p>
							<p>The Kursaal first appeared within unused rooms in the recently built Cousens Gymnasium in 1940, yet moved into Curtis Hall shortly thereafter. Curtis Hall was converted into a barracks during World War II, and offered up attractive dining space once the soldiers left.</p>
							<p>Unlike Brown and Brew, Kursaal utilized two floors and several rooms, originally featuring blue walls and brown upholstery. In 1962, due to student complaints of 'depressing' and 'morbid,' the original interior was renovated, brown and blue giving way to a black and white theme.</p>
							<p>Originally intended as a place for the rest and relaxation of off-the Hill students and alumni, Kursaal soon came to be a favorite for all. As there was no official campus center, the Kursaal ably served as such. Card-playing, reading, playing ping-pong, watching TV, eating, and drinking were the activities of the day.</p>
							<p>Not all, unfortunately, was fun and games. Controversy was soon to come in a scene similar to the 2000 "TVs-in-Dewick" complaint, a mild protest was waged upon the installation of a new, more expensive and 'corporate' jukebox in 1964.</p>
							<p>A fire in Curtis Hall in 1977 damaged the concession, but the Kursaal continued to provide a popular student gathering place. Then, on December 14, 1984, the Kursaal posted its last menu. On February 1, 1985, with expanded menu and facilities, the Campus Commons opened in the new Elizabeth van Huysen Meyer Campus Center, and the Kursaal was replaced. The basement of Curtis Hall where the Kursaal once lay is now unused except for storage, though the Center for Environmental Management had for a time occupied the area.</p>

At the time, life at Tufts was not easy. Nevertheless he managed to pay his fees through scholarships and part-time work. Students volunteered to read for him and guide him, when needed. His love for and knowledge of the campus were legendary. Without a white cane he navigated it infallibly by counting his paces. His deep interest in music eventually turned to romance languages and literature, and Dante became his favorite poet. Among the many people who came to read to him was a Wellesley student, Margaret Chamberlain, and their common affinities drew them together into marriage. While she collected fine prints, he accumulated a great collection of musical recordings, and they eagerly shared their interests and possessions with the young generation in many ways, including many donations to Tufts. </p>

Lane with rock in a laboratory, February 27, 1931</head></figure>Alfred Church Lane (1863-1948) was Pearson Professor of Geology and Mineralogy from 1909-36 and recipient of the Ballou Medal. Best known for directing research on the determination of the age of the Earth, he is also known by some atomic scientists as the "Forgotten Man" of atomic research for his role in early work on splitting the atom.</p>
							<p>A descendent of Thomas Dudley, a founder and four-time governor of the Massachusetts Bay colony, Lane was born on January 29, 1863, in Boston and attended Boston Latin High School. After graduating from Harvard in 1883, he remained at the institution as a mathematics instructor. From 1885 to 1887 he studied at the University of Heidelberg, returning to Harvard in 1888 to receive his doctorate. The following year he worked as petrographer of the Michigan State Geological Survey and as an instructor in the Michigan College of Mines. He achieved the position of state geologist for Michigan before returning to the East Coast in 1909 to take up the position of Pearson Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at Tufts. He remained at the college until his retirement in 1936, at which time he became Pearson Professor of Geology and Mineralogy Emeritus. This action was in response to his decision not to subscribe to the state's teachers' oath. In 1940, he was the recipient of the Ballou Medal for distinguished service to education and the Nation, awarded by Tufts College. </p>
							<p>Working with Otto Hahn, a German scientist, Lane helped to inaugurate an international plan for the exchange of scientific information on smashing the atom in the early 1920s. Lane was the first American to receive notice from Hahn about his successful splitting of a uranium atom in 1938, who immediately passed the information on to Washington. In 1929, Lane became the first consultant in science ever appointed at the Library of Congress. Over the course of his lifetime, he published 1087 articles and reports in both scientific and general journals. He was also a past president of the Geological Society of America and was affiliated with several international geologic and academic associations. He also supported the YMCA and was a dedicated servant of the Boy Scouts of America. A peleochoric amphibole mineral, known as Lanenite, is named for the scientist.</p>
							<p>Lane Hall, home to the Geology Department and former headquarters of the Bouve-Boston School of Occupational Therapy and Physical Education was dedicated in Lane's honor in 1968. There is also a memorial tablet in Goddard Chapel.</p>
							<p>Lane died on April 14, 1948 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife and three children, including Fredric C. Lane, G1922. </p>

							<p>Architects from the Ehrenkrantz Group and John Carl Warnecke and Associates designed the building, which was formally dedicated and opened in 1982. Both firms had extensive experience in veterinary and academic construction. The building's brick exterior was designed to resemble the barns and farm sheds of rural Massachusetts, and was instantly popular with the surrounding communities. </p>
							<p>Since its opening, the Hospital for Large Animals has become one of the Veterinary School's most utilized facilities. It has helped expand horse racing in Massachusetts, as there is now a medical facility which can handle horses, and its farm animal section has helped local farmers expand dairy production. </p>

							<p>Born in Germany, Leir began his career at a Bonn-based metals and mining business. He fled Nazi Germany in 1933, establishing residence in Luxembourg, where he remained until 1938. In 1938, Leir left for the United States, where he established the Continental Ore Corporation and a number of successful trading companies worldwide.</p>
							<p>Leir sold his business in 1968 and became a philanthropist, with Tufts often benefiting from his generosity. He made substantial donations to the Elizabeth Van Huysen Mayer Campus Center, and was an early supporter of the Tufts European Center in Talloires.

							<p> The Leonard Carmichael Society (LCS) was founded in 1958 by Richard Dorsay, A1960, M1964, to coordinate student visits to a nearby mental hospital. Over the years LCS grew to become the umbrella organization for dozens of community service and volunteer programs participated in by undergraduates.</p>
							<p>During the 1960s, LCS prospered with over 1,000 volunteers, and it was featured on the cover of Life magazine. In the 1970s, membership dwindled to fifteen members. LCS began to regain popularity in the 1980s and even more so in the 1990s. As of 2000 LCS has expanded its programs and opportunities to comprise a volunteer corps of over 1000 and a staff of eighty-five, making it Tufts' largest undergraduate student organization. </p>
							<p>LCS is named for Leonard Carmichael, president of Tufts from 1938 to 1952.Dr. Carmichael demonstrated interest in a wide variety of activities beyond his academic expertise and made a career of service to organizations of national importance, including the Smithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, and the American Philosophical Society. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02233"><head>Dr. Charles H. Leonard, ca. 1880</head></figure>Charles H. Leonard (1822-1918), G1869, was the second dean of the Tufts Divinity School (1891-1910) and grandfather of Tufts president Leonard Carmichael. During his forty-nine years at Tufts, Leonard made a deep and lasting impression upon the morale, scholarship, and standards of the divinity school and Tufts College.</p>
							<p>Leonard was born in Northwood, New Hampshire, on September 16, 1822, and moved to Haverhill, Massachusetts, with his family during his childhood. He attended Haverhill public schools, Atkinson Academy in New Hampshire, and Bradford Seminary. Before entering the ministry, Leonard taught in the school house made famous by Whittier in his poem, "Snow Bound." Although he was inclined toward the Universalist ministry, no universalistic theology school was accessible to Leonard, so he chose to attend the Clinton Liberal Institute in New York, studying for two years under Thomas J. Sawyer. </p>
							<p>Following his training, Leonard became pastor the Universalist Church of the Redeemer in Chelsea, Massachusetts, from 1848-70. His congregation, especially the Sunday school, grew remarkably. In 1848, he married Phoebe Basset, who died, after having three children, in 1872. In 1857, Leonard established Children's Day, the second Sunday in June, which was annually observed and eventually adopted by most Protestant churches in the area. He also published a prayer book which was widely used by Universalist ministers and churches.</p>
							<p>In 1869, Sawyer, who had by that time become the first dean of Tufts Divinity School, asked Leonard to join him in Medford, as his assistant. For two years, Leonard continued to work both at Tufts and in Chelsea, but surrendered his position in the church after becoming the Professor of Homiletics and Pastoral Theology at the school in 1871.With Sawyer's retirement from active service, Leonard became the informal leader of the school in 1884.Following Sawyer's full retirement in 1891, Leonard was appointed dean of the School of Theology, holding the position until 1910.</p>
							<p>Leonard also served on the board of examiners for Harvard College and was a leader of the Ministers' Club, a group of ministers, primarily connected with educational institutions, which lived within a ten-mile radius of Boston. Tufts conferred upon him a master's degree in 1869, while St. Lawrence University presented him with a doctorate of sacred theology in 1881. Leonard died August 27, 1918. </p>

							<head>Lewis Hall, 1969</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01652"><head>Courtyard of Lewis Hall, ca. 1990</head></figure>Lewis Hall was constructed in 1969-70 to serve as a dormitory, originally intended for Jackson College, but by the time of its opening, it was designated a co-educational dormitory for undergraduate students, the first such on the Medford campus. The building was designed by Hugh Stubbins. In 1972, the hall was named for the late Leo Rich Lewis, professor of music and composer of numerous Tufts songs.</p>
							<p>Construction of the building was plagued with unrest, principally having to do with minority represenation among the contractor's workforce. At the outset of construction the university was concerned that the contractor comply with new federal regulations regarding minority representation in the workforce on federally funded projects. As the perception grew that the contractor was not taking adequate steps in this area, the Afro American Society at Tufts, a student organization, became heavily involved in the matter. A series of peaceful confrontations between students and faculty and the construction company ensued. Due to the continuing concern about minority represenation, Tufts filed suit in state court in the fall of 1969 seeking a declaratory judgment as to whether or not the contractor had been in compliance with affirmative action guidelines. The construction company countersued, though both suits were dropped after negotiations were settled regarding outstanding payments.</p>
							<p>Prior to the dedication of the building in Professor Lewis' honor, it was known among the students as "Freefer Hall" after an article which appeared in the Observer on April 10, 1970, cited a gift from Mr. and Mrs. Quentin P. Freefer, both Tufts graduates and champions of equal rights for both sexes. Despite obvious signs that the article was a hoax, including the byline under which the article appeared, Ima F. Rawde, Freefer Hall quickly took hold as the name of the new building. With the University's decision to officially name the building Lewis Hall, students petitioned unsuccessfully to keep the original name.</p>
							<p>As of 1999, Lewis Hall continues to be used as a dormitory for undergraduates. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.011.DO.01136"><head>Professor Leo Lewis, ca. 1920</head></figure>Leo Rich Lewis (1865-1945), A1887, H1922, was professor of music and head of the Department of Music for fifty years. One of the "Grand Old Men" of the college, he composed the music for Tufts' "Alma Mater" in 1898, and was responsible for making Tufts known as "the Singing College." Tufts poet John Holmes, in his work "Leo Rich Lewis, 1865-1945" stated,"We heard his music rise, his morning shout. We heard his heart in light."</p>
							<p>Lewis was born in South Woodstock, Vermont, on February 11, 1865 to Universalist minister and Tufts alumnus John Jay Lewis, A1863, M1866.In 1867, the Lewis family moved to South Boston, Massachusetts, where Lewis attended the Lincoln Grammar School and then went on to Boston English and Boston Latin High Schools, graduating in 1879 and 1883, respectively. While still in high school he became a printer with his own press. He taught the subject at the Farm and TradeSchool on Thompson's Island, Boston Harbor. Entering Tufts in 1883, Lewis continued to be quite active in extracurricular activities, which included being a member of Zeta Psi fraternity, the Tufts baseball team, an editor of the Tuftonian, and the college organist from 1886-1887.He received several academic prizes and delivered the Class Day Oration during Commencement Week his senior year. His love of music was reflected in his efforts to found a glee club almost immediately after enrolling at Tufts. The organization gave its first concert in the chapel in Ballou Hall in the spring of 1886, accompanied by the Mandolin Club, which Lewis also organized. While a student at Tufts, Lewis composed several cantatas and operettas for children, along with Tufts songs "Love It for Aye" and the "Barnum Song," which was presented by the Glee Club at commencement in 1886 (the only time that Barnum visited the campus).After graduating form Tufts in 1887, Lewis earned a second Bachelor of Arts degree, majoring in Music, from Harvard University in 1888, and then a Masters degree with highest honors from the same institution in 1889.He then studied at the Munich Conservatory until July 1892.While in Germany, Lewis met and spoke with composer Johnanes Brahms. Returning to the United States in 1892, Lewis assumed a position of instructor in French at Tufts. Lewis was named professor of the History and Theory of Music in 1895, following Albert Metcalf's proposal and funding of a Music department at Tufts. In 1920, he was made professor of Music and associate professor of Modern Languages and in 1924, he was selected to become the Fletcher Professor of Music, the first of five endowed professorships awarded at the bequest of Austin B. Fletcher. He continued to split his time between the French and Music departments until 1926, when he relinquished his other appointment in order to devote himself fully to the Music Department as its head. He continued to chair the department for nineteen years, until his death on September 8, 1945.</p>
							<p>Known as Tufts' "Dean of Music," Lewis was connected to all things musical at Tufts. His association with Tufts, aside from "Dear Alma Mater," include the publication of four editions of the Tufts College Song Book (1895, 1906,1915, 1922) and The Evolution of Tufts Music (1922). He was instrumental in establishing dramatics at Tufts and served as an early advisor and support of Pen, Paint and Pretzels (3Ps), a student theatrical troupe. He chaired several faculty committees and continued to organize and oversee men's and women's glee clubs, college bands, orchestras, and other musically oriented organizations during his time at Tufts. A staple at Tufts Night at the Pops, Lewis received the baton from conductor and long-time friend, Arthur Fieldler, to lead the group in the playing and singing of the alma mater. In 1922, Tufts conferred on Lewis the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters in recognition of his many contributions to the college in a wide range of fields, but especially music. Outside of Tufts, Lewis held many positions within local and national musical and educational organizations.</p>
							<p>Lewis married Carrie Nichols Bullard, a fellow composer and accompanianist in December of 1892. They resided at 20 Professors Row, the oldest home on campus, originally built in 1855 for Hosea Ballou 2d, and, since the summer of 1989, the house has appropriately been home to the Department of Music. The Lewis' had one son, Philip Bullard Lewis, A1918.Upon the graduation of their granddaughter, Barbara, from the college in 1942, the Lewis family became the first in Tufts history to have produced four generations of alumni.</p>
							<p>Lewis Hall, the first co-educational undergraduate dormitory was named in Lewis' honor. </p>

							<p> The Lincoln Filene Center was built in 1962 to house the offices of the former Tufts Civic Education Center. Upon moving into the new building, the program was renamed and the building was dedicated as the Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs. </p>
							<p>In 1961, Tufts University received a $200,000 grant from the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation to build a new headquarters for the Tufts Civic Education Program. The program had previously been housed in a one-story building between Cousens Gym and the Boston and Maine Rail Road building. </p>
							<p>Construction began in early 1962, and by early 1963, after $250,000 in total building costs, the Lincoln Filene Center was ready for use. The building included offices, classrooms, conference and seminar rooms, and an exhibit area. Originally, the building housed not only the newly renamed Citizenship and Public Affairs program, but also the Department of Government and the Department of Education. The Tufts Young Democrats and Young Republicans also had office space in the building. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, the Lincoln Filene Center houses the Department of Education, and is also home to one of the newest Tufts Initiatives, the College of Citizenship and Public Service, funded in part by alumni Pierre Omidyar. </p>

							<head>Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs, 1954</head>
							<p> The Lincoln Filene Center was established at Tufts University in 1954, when the Civic Education Foundation, founded in 1945, was relocated to Tufts and renamed the the Tufts College Center for Civic Education. The mission of the Lincoln Filene Center is to increase the will and capacity of individuals and organizations to build healthy communities through active citizenship and public service. This is accomplished primparily through education, training, and research in the nonprofit and voluntary sectors and through the promotion of public service as both a vehicle and an arena for lifelong learning. The Lincoln Filene Center is an independent institution affiliated with Tufts University.</p>
							<p>The origin of the Lincoln Filene Center dates to 1945 when its predecessor, the Civic Education Foundation was founded with a mission to "support civic education programs designed to further the values of a free society for which American men and women had died during World War II."The work of the Foundation focused on "developing innovative and appealing isntructional resources in civic education and the social studies," and worked closely with Boston-area schools. In 1954, the foundation relocated to Tufts University in Medford and was renamed the Tufts College Center for Civic Educaion. In 1955, the Lincoln and Therese Filene Foundation endowed the Lincoln Filene Professorship in Citizen ship and Public Affairs at Tufts. Six years later the Center was given its current name.</p>
							<p>The period from 1959 to 1968 was arguably the most publicly visible in the LIncoln Filene Center's history. Each year it hosted the annual Massachusetts Assemblies on State Government, where leaders in state politics, business, labor, agriculture, education, and students would meet for several days to discuss matters of puclic policy. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the Lincoln Filene Center continued to organize conferences on citizenship and sponsor research on citizen participation in democracy, but it also provided training on community service learning for teachers, parents, and staff of nonprofit organizations. During the 1990s the Center worked to foster greater collaboration between public schoolsand community-based organizations that provide after-school activities and job training skills. Each summer the center offers a Management and Community Development Institute for staff and executives of nonprofit organizations to build skills including fundraising, microenterprise development, housing development, management, coalition-building and volunteer recruitment. The center also sponsors occasional papers and research by Tufts faculty, students, and alumni writing on citizenship, democracy, community economic development, and social policy.</p>
							<p>The organizational structure of the center was revamped in 1998, and is comprised of five programmatically linked components: the National Institute for School-Community Collaboration (NISCC), Management and Community Development Institute (MCDI), National Focus on Citizenship and Democracy (NFCD), University College of Public Service (UCPS), and Communications and Infrastructure. the NFCD will provide opportunities for students, faculty, and community-based nonprofits to learn about and take action on public policy issues. The UCPS is working to integrate public service concepts into the curricula of every school and department at Tufts.</p>
							<p>The Lincoln Filene Center is located in a building of the same name, constructed in 1963 adjacent to Braker Hall on the Medford campus. </p>

Littleton</head></figure>Earle Frederick Littleton (1908-1994), E1931, spent more than forty-five years at Tufts, moving from student to head of the Department of Civil Engineering. A loyal professor and alum, Littleton's approach to life at Tufts was typified by his motto, "students come first."</p>
							<p>Littleton enrolled at Tufts in 1927 and remained at the institution until his retirement in 1974. As a student he excelled in athletics (football, wrestling, and lacrosse) and participated in many other campus activities, including the Ivy Society, the Ivy Book, and Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He was also Marshal of the Tower Cross and president of his senior class. Upon graduation he became assistant in Civil Engineering, he became an instructor in 1935.Having continued his studies at Harvard, Littleton applied to the Graduate School of Tufts College in 1936. He was appointed as an assistant professor in 1941, an associate professor in 1947, and a full professor in 1953. From 1958 to 1969, Littleton was chairman of the Department of Civil Engineering. His other ties to Tufts included his service as football and lacrosse coach, chairman of the Academic Awards Committee, and director of war training courses, along with his presence on several of the university's committees. </p>

							<p> Mary A. Livermore (1820-1905), H1896, was the first female to receive an honorary degree from Tufts College. </p>
							<p>Born on Dec. 19, 1820, in Boston, Mary A. Rice began her education in Boston public schools. She transferred to a Charlestown seminary school for four years, where she continued as a teacher after her graduation. She soon moved and began working as a teacher at a family school on a southern plantation, where she first came in direct contact with slavery. This experience made her an ardent abolitionist. She moved back north and married Rev. Daniel P. Livermore, a Universalist clergyman, on May 6, 1845. </p>
							<p>Mrs. Livermore gained fame for her work with the United States Sanitary Commission during the Civil War. She also became a noted member of the Women's Suffrage movement, and spent much of her life involved in causes related to the advancement of women. </p>
							<p>A long time friend of Tufts, Mrs. Livermore wrote a poem entitled "Tufts College" in 1855. This poem appeared in various publications, including the centennial issue of Tuftonian magazine in June 1952. </p>
							<p>Mrs. Livermore received an honorary degree of LL. D. from Tufts College at Commencement in 1896, making her the first female to receive an honorary degree at the college. </p>
							<p>She died at her home in Melrose, Massachusetts, on May 23, 1905. </p>

							<p> Donald Ross MacJannet (1894-1986), A1916, H1933, H1979, was a benefactor of Tufts University and an educator who established his own international schools and camps. His greatest gift to the institution was the property in Talloires, France, which the university uses as the European Center.</p>
							<p>A descendent of Peregrine White, the baby born on the Mayflower, MacJannet was orphaned at an early age and raised, along with his sister, in the home of a Medford, Massachusetts, widow. In 1912, he graduated as valedictorian of Medford High School and entered Tufts College on a partial scholarship. He earned a B.A. in French literature in 1916. He then attended the Sorbonne in France.</p>
							<p>In 1923, MacJannet founded a school just outside of Paris in St. Cloud, known as the MacJannet School for Young Americans. He opened a second school in Paris and acquired some land in Taillores the following year. There he started two camps, one for girls and the other for boys, which attracted an international clientele, spreading his reputation as an educator throughout the world. Some of his notable campers and students include Prince Phillip of Great Britain, Indira Ghandi, the late Prime Minister of India, and Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart. In 1932, MacJannet was elected to the Legion of Honor. His schools operated for seventeen years, closing in the early 1940s. The camps continued until 1964, with a brief hiatus during World War II.During the war, the MacJannets returned to the United States, operating a school and camp in Sun Valley, Idaho and helping with the war effort in Washington, D.C. </p>
							<p>In 1944, Tufts president Leonard Carmichael called on the MacJannets to help consolidate the college's dental and medical schools in the new Harrison Avenue, Boston campus. As soon as they were able, the MacJannets returned to France to resume their camps' normal operations.</p>
							<p>The MacJannets purchased an eleventh century Benedictine priory in Talloires France in 1958. MacJannnet restored the building for use as an educational facility, using it for twenty years as a center to house educational and cultural events. In 1979, the MacJannets turned the property over to Tufts University, which established its European campus and conference center on the premises.</p>
							<p>MacJannet died on April 4, 1986 in Geneva, Switzerland. </p>

							<p>Born in Bridgton, Maine, on March 28, 1891, Etta Phillips attended Lowell High School before entering Jackson College. As an undergraduate, she was a member of Alpha Omicron Pi sorority. She financed her college education by reading for Professor Edwin Bolles. Her work with this blind faculty member first sparked MacPhie's interest in working with the visually impared. Graduating in 1913, MacPhie taught high school in Lowell for two years. In 1915, she married Elmore I. MacPhie, A1911. The couple had two sons, Rodney and Franklin, A1942.</p>
							<p>She continued her work in support of the blind following graduation, helping to found the National Braille Press and organize the Lowell Association for the Blind. She also served on the corporation of the Perkins School for the Blind, and on the executive committee of the Massachusetts Association for the Blind. She was a patron of the arts and other philanthropic endeavors around Boston. </p>
							<p>In 1955, following the death of her husband, MacPhie was elected to the Board of Trustees of Tufts University, having the distinction of being the first graduate of Jackson College to hold such a position. She also joinedthe Tufts Alumni Council in 1949 and was recipient of the Distinguished Service Award in 1951 and again in 1972.In 1974, she stepped down from the Board, retaining the title Trustee Emeritus. Two years later, Tufts awarded MacPhie with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. She died on November 16, 1978.</p>
							<p>In 1970, when the Tufts student body boycotted the traditional commencement and organized their own ceremony the following day, MacPhie attended the event, talking with students and listening to their antiwar music. She was disappointed by the choice they had made to skip commencement the previous day, but she wanted to share the occasion with them and was welcomed by class members. </p>
							<p>In response to MacPhie's continued support of the students of Tufts, the student government president marched into the last Trustees meeting of the year and demanded that she immediately become an honorary member of the student body since she "had more rapport with students than any other member of the community."The representative also demanded that she accept a donation for the formation of a scholarship in her name and a charm for her bracelet.</p>

							<head>Marianne J. H. Witherby Prize in Archaeology, </head>
							<p> The Marianne J. H. Witherby Prize in Archaeology was established by Marianne Witherby, an alumna of Tufts who is a devoted supporter of archaeological studies at the university. The prize is awarded each year to an archaeology major in recognition of scholastic ability, dedication to the discipline, and resourcefulness.</p>
							<p>Marianne J. H. Witherby, J1976, was born in the Swedish socialist community of Jamestown, New York, in 1914. Her paternal grandparents had immigrated from Sm&#x00E5;land to escape the potato blight. Her grandfather arrived at age fourteen changed his name to Jones, lied about his age, and joined the Union Navy. Her maternal grandparents arrived from Stockholm on the Carpathia at the turn of the century. Her father was a lawyer who opened his first office with Robert H. Jackson, later of the U.S. Supreme Court. The family traveled extensively to oil fields in Wyoming and Montana where her father tried to prevent illegal oil drilling on Indian reservations. She finished high school in the east. When her father sent her to college, the old Swedes objected to educating a woman as a waste of money. He said, "You educate a man and you educate one person. You educate a woman, you educate a whole family." College was not a happy experience for her and law school was worse-women were not wanted there. She worked in radio and advertising instead, wrote articles for Gourmet Magazine, did a cooking show on TV. As her children grew up (Tom from a brief first marriage, Connie from her marriage to Thomas Witherby, Harvard '36, an electrical engineer with Raytheon) she traveled and wrote articles about Europe for the Boston Globe.</p>
							<p>When she wrote about Greek Bronze Age ruins, Marianne Witherby found that there was little agreement among archaeologists concerning important dates. Emily Vermeule from Harvard suggested she take some classes. Tufts was the only institution to offer a suitable program. A trial run during summer school was made difficult by concurrent treatment for a just-diagnosed cancer. She ended the summer session with an A and a B and cancer cured. Four years later, at age 62, she graduated magna cum laude with majors in archaeology and Greek and Roman studies. She enjoyed her years at Tufts and has been among the most vigorous supporters of the archaeology program here ever since. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00601"><head>John P. Marshall, 1875</head></figure> John Potter Marshall (1832-1901), one of the first members of the Tufts faculty, was connected to the college for more than forty-five years. He served as acting president of the institution following Hosea Ballou's death in 1861.</p>
							<p>Marshall, the great great grandson of Governor Dudley of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was born in Kingtson, New Hampshire, on August 11, 1823. Before entering Yale in 1840, Marshall attended local academies and worked for a year as a carriage builder in Boston. Following graduation, Marshall spent several years teaching in New England academies and also traveled south to be with his invalid brother. He later returned to New England to resume teaching, moving from his hometown to Danvers, Massachusetts, where he became principal of the high school there. Charles Leonard, future dean of the Tufts Divinity School, recruited him to be principal of Chelsea High School. In 1853, Marshall married Caroline Clement, with whom he had two children. She died in 1895. </p>
							<p>Seeing it"as his duty as a universalist to aid the advancement of the college by every means in his power," Marshall left Chelsea to join the faculty of the fledgling institution. He did not immediately vacate his position in Chelsea, teaching there in the morning and at Tufts in the afternoon. Initially charged with instructing all of the scientific work of the college, Marshall eventually limited his courses to mineralogy and geology as the faculty grew in size. As the first faculty member appointed, Marshall served as Professor of Math and Physics from 1855 to 65, and then held the position of Professor of Mineralogy and Geology until 1901.He also served as Professor of Chemistry (1865-76), and Director of Barnum Museum (1892-1898). Following Hosea Ballou's death in 1861, Marshall was appointed acting president of the college for one year. He had also served as dean of the faculty from 1892 to 1898. </p>
							<p>During the Civil War, Marshall spent two years in hospital service in the South. In 1872 and 1874, Marshall traveled abroad, studying mineralogy and geology throughout Europe.</p>
							<p>In his spare time, he would grind lenses for the college's laboratory equipment and maintain the college's fossil collection, comprised mainly of his private pieces. He built the second house on the hill, at 48 Professors Row, two years after coming to Medford, and resided there until his death on February 4, 1901. A bronze bas relief in memory of Marshall is located in Goddard Chapel. </p>

							<head>The Masque Society, 1916-1930</head>
							<p> The Masque Society of Jackson College was formed in 1916 to promote dramatics and to present at least one production annually. </p>
							<p>Although the first meetings of the Masque Society were held in the fall of 1915, the group was not officially established until spring of 1916. The society itself consisted of Jackson students only, but the plays they presented included both male and female students. Generally, the Masque Society voted on a proposed play, and picked a faculty member to direct it. The society then designated a stage manager from its own ranks, and auditioned actors from around campus. </p>
							<p>Although its stated purposes were to present one play annually and discuss plays, dramatists, costumes, and all that could be termed dramatic, the Masque Society basically concentrated on producing plays. By the mid-1920's, the Masque Society presented at least two plays a year, often opening the season with a night of one-acts. </p>
							<p>By 1926, discussion had begun among Masque Society members concerning a possible merger with Pen, Paint, and Pretzels, the men's drama club. The Masque Society and Pen, Paint, and Pretzels formed a joint advisory committee to discuss both groups' annual plans, but remained officially separated. Finally, in spring 1930, the Masque Society voted to officially join Pen, Paint, and Pretzels. Since both groups produced plays featuring male and female performers, and both played similar roles in organizing their productions, the merger allowed them to combine treasuries and sponsor more ambitious plays. </p>
							<p>The Masque Society disbanded in 1930, merging with Pen Paint and Pretzels, whcih remains Tufts largest undergraduate drama group. </p>

							<p> The Mathetican Society was created in 1854, and was the leading undergraduate literature and debate club for the first four decades after the opening of Tufts College. </p>
							<p>Thomas H. Angell, A1858, led the effort to found the Mathetican Society, which became the first student society at Tufts College. It soon became a literary organization typical of those flourishing on almost every college campus in the nineteenth century. Mathetican Society meetings were serious affairs with formal programs that included debates, essays, orations, and poems on topics such as taxes, women's suffrage, and world peace. </p>
							<p>The Mathetican Society had two annual traditions. Every October, the Society held a special exercise in recognition of its anniversary. Until 1875, the Mathetican Society also had the privilege of creating a formal program to follow the annual commencement ceremony for graduates and their families. </p>
							<p>As the popularity of fraternities and other organizations began to grow on campus, the Mathetican Society began to falter. Membership waned, and in 1896, the Mathetican Society officially disbanded, transferring its entire treasury to the Tufts Debating Union. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01302"><head> President Jean Mayer at Commencement, May 1982</head></figure>Dr. Jean Mayer (1920-93), 10th president (1976-92) of Tufts University and renowned nutritionist, was born in Paris on February 19, 1920, to noted physiologists Andre and Jeanne Eugenie Mayer. At age 16, Mayer matriculated at the University of Paris, where he earned degrees with high honors in 1937, 1938, and 1939, before becoming a fellow of the Ecole Normale Superieur.</p>
							<p>During World War II, Mayer entered the French army as a cadet and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field artillery before being captured by German forces in 1940. After shooting a guard, Mayer escaped prison camp and joined the French underground. He acted as an agent for British intelligence in Vichy France and later served on the private staff of General Charles de Gaulle in London. </p>
							<p>Mayer fought with the Free French and Allied forces in North Africa and Italy, and participated in the Allied landing in southern France and the Battle of the Bulge. In recognition of his service, Mayer was awarded 14 decorations, including the Croix de Guerre, the Resistance Medal, and the rank of chevalier in the Legion of Honor. </p>
							<p>After the war, Mayer married Elizabeth Van Huysen of Boston and settled in the United States. As a fellow at the Rockefeller Foundation, Mayer studied physiological chemistry at Yale University, where he was awarded a Ph. D. in 1948. In 1948-1949, Dr. Mayer initiated a long and distinguished career of service to national and international organizations working on matters of health and nutrition when he served as an advisor to the United Nations Economic and Social Council on nutrition. In 1950 he received a D.Sc. in physiology summa cum laude at the Sorbonne. </p>
							<p>Mayer then joined the faculty at Harvard University as an assistant professor where he taught and researched nutrition for 26 years. He was promoted to associate professor in 1956 and professor in 1965. Beginning in 1961, Mayer lectured on the history of public health and in 1968 he became a member of the university's Center for Population Studies.</p>
							<p>While at Harvard, Mayer conducted pioneering research on obesity and appetite control and was credited with discovering how hunger is regulated by the utilization of glucose in the brain. He also studied the problems of poverty and malnutrition and conducted important studies which revealed far higher levels of malnutrition among blacks than among whites in the United States.</p>
							<p>From 1955-69, Mayer participated in a number of relief and advisory missions to India, Ghana, the Ivory Coast and West Africa. Over the course of his career, Mayer advised the United States government, the Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Health Organization of the United Nations.</p>
							<p>In 1969, Mayer was tapped by President Nixon to organize and chair the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health. This conference is credited with creating the impetus which led to the introduction of food stamps for the poor and an expansion of the school lunch program for needy children. After the conference, Mayer returned to Harvard to co-direct the Center for Population Studies and master Dudley House, one of Harvard's largest undergraduate houses.</p>
							<p>In 1971, Mayer chaired the nutrition division of the White House Conference on Aging and in 1974 he coordinated the U.S. Senate National Nutrition Policy Study. Mayer also served as director of the task force on priorities in child nutrition for the United Nations Children's Fund and was a member of the Protein Advisory Group of the United Nations.</p>
							<p>On September 18th of 1976, Mayer was inaugurated as the 10th president of Tufts University. At Tufts, Mayer created the first graduate school of nutrition in the United States and New England's only school of veterinary medicine. Mayer also developed the Tufts United States Department of Agriculture Nutrition Research Center on Aging in Boston as well as the Center for Environmental Management. </p>
							<p>During Mayer's presidency, Tufts increased its endowment to $200 million from $30 million and completed a $145 million drive for capital construction. Mayer is credited with giving the university a new sense of identity and raising its admissions standards and the academic quality of its undergraduate student body.</p>
							<p>In 1985, as chairman of the New England Board of Higher Education, Mayer established a scholarship fund to help non-white South Africans pay for education at fully integrated universities in their homeland. Also in 1985, Mayer orchestrated an interactive video conference via satellite between medical professionals at Tufts and in Beijing, China. In 1988, he initiated a global classroom project in which students at Tufts and Moscow State universities participated in classroom sessions via satellite on nuclear age history and the arms race. </p>
							<p>Between 1988-90, Mayer organized and convened annual conferences of university presidents from around the world at the Tufts European Center in Talloires, France. The Talloires University Presidents Group discussed strategies for addressing through curricula and research the problems of arms control and conflict management, higher education in apartheid South Africa, and the environment.</p>
							<p>Mayer was elevated to chancellor on September 1, 1992, after 16 years as the university's president. He died of a heart attack on January 1, 1993, in Sarasota, Florida at the age of 72.</p>

When suggested by a student in 1937, the administration readily accepted the idea of the mayoralty campaigns as potentially channeling the springtime enthusiasm of undergraduates into organized mayhem rather than the other types of pre-finals mischief that had been the norm. The mock political elections were a celebration of school spirit and an opportunity for carefree fun before the seriousness of finals.</p>
							<p>Mayoralty began in January or February as fraternities, sororities, and student groups decided which candidates to support. Candidates ran under whimsical names such as Stuporman, Captain Question Mark, Lucky Pierre, and Diamond Mike, though historical figures also played a role, such as Annie Oakley, P.T. Barnum, and Geronimo. During the campaign, candidates and their supporters staged soapbox speeches, skits, parades, dance bands, comedy acts, costumes, live animals, fancy floats, and trucks with public address systems. Involvement in the event was all-encompassing, with almost all members of the Tufts community getting involved.</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.04059"><head> Dean Lee Sullivan McCollester, ca. 1885</head></figure>Lee Sullivan McCollester, (1859-1943) A1881, D1884, D1899, third dean of the Crane Theological School (1912-1933), was an dedicated alumnus, professor, and administrator, who was considered the "Mr. Chips" of Tufts College.</p>
							<p>Born in Westmoreland, New Hampshire, June 5, 1859, McCollester began his formal education at Melrose Seminary in Brattleboro, Vermont. He first attended Butchel College in Akron Ohio, where his father, a clergyman, was president of the school. However, he transferred to Tufts at the end of his sophomore year. McCollester received a B.A. (1881) and a S.T. B. (1884) from the college and the Divinity School, respectively. He had studied under Charles H. Leonard, the first dean of the Divinity School. During his last year of theological study, McCollester worked as minister of the Claremont, New Hampshire, Univeralist Church. During that time he was briefly married to Lillian A. Wright, who died in 1884.</p>
							<p>McCollester was recruited by the Church of Our Father in Detroit, Michigan, in 1889. He served as the urban church's pastor for twenty-four years. There, he established a life-long friendship with Henry Ford. Tufts conferred an honorary S.T.D. (Doctorate of Sacred Theology) on McCollester in 1899.He returned to Tufts, accepting the deanship of the Crane School of Theology, in 1912. At the time of his arrival, there were only four divinity students. In order to secure his services, the college agreed to several conditions pertaining to the reorganization of the school and McCollester's personal salary. Tufts was unable to meet all of McCollester's financial demand, requiring A. B. Fletcher, as a result of his personal interest in the theological school, to guarantee a personal gift of $1000 a year to the new dean until the funds could be raised from other resources. McCollester revitalized the theological school, altering the curriculum to focus more on practical usage, and increasing the enrollment under his leadership. McCollester was made dean emeritus upon his retirement in 1932. His second wife, Lizzie S. Parker, whom he married in 1889, was descended from one of the first students to enter the college. She died in 1928.The McCollesters had three children, including Parker McCollester, A1911, who was a life trustee of the college. McCollester retained the title of Professor of Religious Literature and continued to serve as the college's chaplain (1919-1940). He last act at the college, in early December 1943,was reading from Dickens' Christmas Carol for a Tufts College Women's Club gathering in Goddard Chapel.</p>
							<p>From 1906 to 1923, McCollester was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Universalist General Convention, chairing the board for twelve years and serving as president of the Convention for four years.</p>
							<p>He was also president of the Michigan Universalist Convention from 1895 to 1905 and librarian and president of the Universalist Historical Library. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and Phi Beta Kappa.</p>
							<p>McCollester, after being dissuaded from his original idea of building a home on the Hill next to the theology school, resided at 48 Professors Row, until retiring to Claremont, New Hampshire. He died December 26, 1943, following a heart attack, in Stamford, Connecticut.</p>
							<p>McCollester House, located on Edison Avenue, was named in his honor. </p>

Over the years, through the acquisition of additional acreage adjacent to the original campus and the sale of other parcels, the Medford campus achieved its current boundaries.</p>
							<p>The original campus was centered on what is now known as the academic quad, consisting of Ballou Hall and the buildings which were constructed around a lawn at the top of the hill. A road ran through the middle of the quad, curving down to Professors Row. A handfull of houses were scattered along Professors Row, aptly serving as residences for faculty. The lower campus, downhill from the quad and adjoining Powderhouse Boulevard, was occupied by pasturage, farm fields, and a large man-made pond, known as the "Artificial". Originally Tufts owned the land stretching from Powderhouse to Broadway as well, but it was sold off in 1912.</p>
							<p>In the 1920s Tufts hired the landscaping firm of Frederick Law Olmsted to consult on the growth of the campus. Then under the direction of Olmsted's son, Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., the firm brought Olmstedian ideals of landscape design to the campus, spearheading the design of Memorial Steps and the surrounding area. Olmsted recommended that the unused lots on the slope behind Ballou Hall be preserved as open space. Olmstead created a master plan for the campus over the next fifty years which grouped men's dorms in the area of Ellis Oval and included a teaching hospital for the medical school, which would be relocated from the Boston campus. For many years the Olmsted brothers essentially served as the managers of the campus grounds and even hired the first full-time buildings and grounds employee.</p>

							<p>Melissa Beth Meyers is exemplified by the award given annually to a student who has overcome obstacles on the way to graduating from Tufts. High school (the Landmark School in Beverly) was a struggle where she had to work extra hard just to graduate. After high school she was one of the youngest students to be admitted to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Her decision to take academic classes at Tufts was courageous to say the least. The more courses she took, the more she wanted to graduate. Through extra effort and determination she was not only able to graduate with a double major (Art Education, grades K-12) but also had a 3.2 cumulative average. She surprised everyone but herself. Any young person who has to work this hard with the combined Museum School/Tufts curriculum deserves this award.</p>

							<p>Born in Wrentham, Massachusetts, on November 27, 1824, Albert Metcalf served as the Treasurer of the Dennison Manufacturing Company. He married Mary C. Roulston in June, 1860, and had two daughters and a son, Edward Roulston Metcalf, who graduated from Tufts in 1887.</p>
							<p>Metcalf and his wife took great interest in the college and its students. The Metcalfs donated a female dormitory, named Metcalf Hall, in order to ensure that the young women who came to Tufts might have comfortable, home-like surroundings and proper care. The couple's love for artistic and musical art led them to also donate their personal collection to the college on November 27, 1901, after seeing a need for these elements of culture in collegiate education. The Alfred Metcalf Musical Library collection was to be kept from mingling with the college's other holdings and was made up of twenty-five hundred volumes, including the Fredric Louis Ritter Library, a collection of rare musical scores and texts; a Chickering Concert Grand Piano; an Aeolian Grand; and a portable music cabinet.</p>
							<p>Metcalf was presented with an honorary degree of Master of Arts from Tufts in 1902.</p>

In 1839 he was ordained a Universalist minister. In 1848 he succeeded Hosea Ballou (the elder) as pastor of the Second Universalist Church of Boston, a post he held until his death. Although Miner had little formal education himself, he was firmly devoted to the cause of education in Massachusetts at all levels. He was at various times a member of the Board of Trustees of Tufts College, the Board of Overseers of Harvard, the Massachusetts State Board of Education and other secular and religious educational institutions.</p>
							<p>Alonzo Miner was involved in many moral and civic organizations. He was very active in the Temperence movement of the mid-nineteenth century on a local and national level, local work relief committees, national and state peace congresses, and other local civic groups.</p>
							<p>Miner was appointed president of Tufts College in 1862, after the untimely death the previous year of Hosea Ballou, 2d. According to the terms of the agreement, Miner continued to hold his position at the Second Universalist Church and received no salary for serving as the president of the college. Miner brought the college back from the brink of financial ruin, and developed many new educational programs. He died on June 14, 1895. A bronze bust in memory of Miner is located in Goddard Chapel. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.02017"><head>Miner Hall, 1892</head></figure>Miner Hall was constructed in 1891 to serve as headquarters for the School of Theology. It was named for Alonzo A. Miner, second president of Tufts College and the major donor to the project. </p>
							<p>The groundbreaking ceremony for Miner Hall took place on October 25, 1891. Miner had donated $40,000 to Tufts in order to build an adequate home for the School of Theology, which had previously been squeezed into Ballou Hall. Architect George F. Loring was hired to design the building. Loring had worked on a number of buildings in the area, including the Somerville Public Library and the Odd Fellows Hall. Loring designed Miner to include classrooms and office space, along with a chapel on the second floor and heating facilities in the basement. Anticipating the possibility of running electricity to the new building, combination gas and electric lighting was installed. The sole stipulation of the grant to build Miner was that funds be raised for an accompanying dormitory, and the subsequent drive resulted in the construction of Paige Hall, immediately next door. </p>
							<p>The School of Theology remained in Miner Hall until 1910, when space at Tufts became extremely limited. The low enrollment numbers in the School of Theology, coupled with the need for a headquarters for newly founded Jackson College, resulted in a redesignation of space. Under a five-year agreement, Miner was converted to house all of Jackson's facilities, and Theology was moved out of the building. </p>
							<p>With the outbreak of World War I, Miner again changed hands. Along with many other buildings on the Tufts campus, Miner was given over to the United States military for use in the war effort, and was not returned to Tufts until the end of the war, at which point the theology department again reclaimed Miner, remaining there through renovations that converted the upstairs chapel into more classroom space, and added a lounge to the basement level. Between 1927 and 1929, Miner was again renovated, and the newly remodeled first floor was designated as the home of the Crane School of Religion.</p>
							<p>Miner remained home to Crane until 1955, when the building was split to include space for the Department of Modern Languages, which later was moved to <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>. After the Department of Modern Languages vacated Miner, the building briefly served as home to part of the History Department, which vacated its offices in Miner when the opening of the Olin Center freed up additional space in <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>. </p>
							<p>Surviving a slew of renovations and even a small fire in 1991, Miner remains in use today. It currently houses the Departments of Philosophy and Comparative Religion, and also serves as headquarters of the Experimental College. </p>

It was named for Stephen P. Mugar, H1979, a major donor to the university and lifelong philanthropist. </p>
							<p>Designed and built by Perry, Shaw, Hepburn, and Dean, Mugar Hall was constructed to connect with Goddard Hall, already in use by the Fletcher School. Mugar, built on the former site of Dean Hall, was to provide extra space for the Fletcher programs, including expanded classroom area, dining facilities, study space, and part of Ginn Library. Mugar also became home to Pound Hall, a graduate dining hall that closed in the late 1990s. During the construction of the Cabot Intercultural Center in the early 1980s, Mugar underwent major renovations to expand library and study space. </p>
							<p>In 1981, Mugar Hall was at the center of a campus controversy after a student group calling itself the Internationalist Student Front painted graffiti on the front of the building the night before a trustee meeting. Using slogans such as "Fletcher = US Fascism," the group attempted to spark campus political discussion. Instead, many viewed the act as nothing but destructive vandalism, and a trustee went as far as to compare it to graffiti on the New York subways, claiming, however, that it was not as artistic.</p>
							<p>In 1988, Trios Restaurant opened in Mugar Hall, providing students with an alternative to dining hall fare. As of 2005, the restaurant is now called Mugar Cafe.</p>
							<p>Also as of 2005, Mugar Hall is home to numerous classrooms, reception rooms, the John and Helen Mugar Graduate Student Computer Lab, part of Ginn Library, the Mugar Cafe, and the Wren Faculty Dining Room. </p>

							<head>Mugar, Stephen P., 1901-1982</head>
							<p> Stephen P. Mugar (1901-1982), H1979, was a lifelong philanthropist and major donor to Tufts University. Mugar Hall, on the Medford campus,was named in his honor.</p>
							<p>Mugar was born on March 5, 1901, in Armenia. He came to the United States with his family in 1906, immediately prior to the Armenian massacres. In 1916, Sarkis Mugar, Stephen's father, bought a small grocery store in Watertown called Star Market. Stephen worked at Star while attending the Boston High School of Commerce until his graduation in 1919. He then began working at Fuller Brush Company, while continuing at Star and attending night classes at the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance. In 1923, Stephen took full responsibility for Star Market after his father was killed in an automobile accident. </p>
							<p>Mugar began his philanthropy early on in life. In 1932, during the Depression-era bank holiday, Mugar announced that Star would extend credit to its customers and would also cash checks. In 1938, when a major hurricane hit Boston and much of the city lost power, Mugar cut five thousand pounds of dry ice into seven-pound blocks, and had Star employees deliver the blocks to homes where children and elderly lived so that their food would not spoil.</p>
							<p>Between 1932 and 1964, Mugar expanded Star Market, and by 1964 he owned thirty-six supermarkets in the area. Mugar also acquired Brigham's Ice Cream in 1960. In 1964, Mugar merged Star and Brigham's with Jewel Tea, Inc., a Chicago company. Mugar continued as chairman of the board at Star until 1969, when he had completed fifty years of service. </p>
							<p>Mugar was a longtime overseer of the Boys and Girls Club in Boston, and also founded the Hundred Club, an organization benefiting families of police and firemen killed in the line of duty. He also gave generously to many local colleges, including Boston University, where he established the Mugar Memorial Library, Boston College, Suffolk, Colby-Sawyer, Northeastern, Brandeis, and MIT. Mugar also donated the funds for Mugar Hall at Tufts. </p>
							<p>Mugar served as a trustee at Boston University, Colby College, Northeastern, and Suffolk, and was a Fellow of Brandeis University. He received numerous honorary degrees recognizing his philanthropy, including a 1979 honorary degree from Tufts University. </p>
							<p>Mugar died of natural causes on October 16, 1982. </p>

He graduated from Tufts College with aB.S. in electrical engineering in 1904.Following graduation, Munro was appointed as an assistant to the electrical engineering department. He became an instructor in the department in 1905 and was made a professor in 1913. During his thirty-seven years on the faculty, Munro worked as the college's official photographer, recording an almost complete pictorial history of campus and student life up until 1941.The Munro Collection, made up of almost 30,000 of his photographs, mounted in more than 100 volumes, is part of the university's special collections held in the University Archives.</p>

							<head>Murrow, Edward R., 1908-1965</head>
							<p> Edward R. Murrow (1908-1965) was a radio and television broadcaster who was the most influential and esteemed figure in American broadcast journalism during its formative years. The Murrow Center of Public Diplomacy at the Fletcher School is named in his honor. Murrow's library and papers, along with memorabilia from his career were donated to Tufts and are held by the University Archives.</p>
							<p>Murrow graduated from Washington State College (now University), Pullman. While a student, he worked to bring German scholars displaced by Nazism to the United States. He joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1935 and was sent to London in 1937 to head the network's European Bureau. Murrow's highly reliable and dramatic eyewitness reportage of the German occupation of Austria and the Munich Conference in 1938, the German takeover of Czechoslovakia in 1939, and the Battle of Britain during World War II brought him national fame and marked radio journalism's coming of age. </p>
							<p>After the war Murrow became CBS vice president in charge of news, education, and discussion programs. He returned to radio broadcasting in 1947 with a weeknight newscast. With Fred W. Friendly he produced Hear It Now, an authoritative hour-long weekly news digest, and moved on to television with a comparable series, See It Now. Murrow was a notable force for the free and uncensored dissemination of information during the American anticommunist hysteria of the early 1950s. In 1954 he produced a notable expos#x00E9; of the dubious tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had gained prominence with flamboyant charges of communist infiltration of U.S. government agencies. Murrow also produced Person to Person (1953-60) and other television programs. He was appointed director of the U.S. Information Agency in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy.</p>
							<p>Illness, however, cut Murrow's tenure at USIA short. After leaving USIA in 1965, Murrow accepted an invitation from the Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Edmund Gullian, to head a Center for Public Diplomacy named after him. Gullian had previously coined the phrase 'public diplomacy' to describe the mix of cultural and student exchange and outreach programs as well as the use of radio and other media to inform, educate and entertain foreign publics as well as to learn the views of others about the United States and U.S. policy actions. Unfortunately, Murrow died before he assumed the position of heading the newly created center which was instead dedicated to his memory. </p>

							<p>The Navy V-12 Program was established in 1942 as part of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps to provide accelerated officer training at American colleges and universities in support of the war effort. During its existence at Tufts, more than 4,000 officers received their training on the Medford campus. Students enrolled in the program were able to complete their college studies, supplemented with special military training prior to being commissioned in the navy.</p>
							<p>The V-12 Program was a boon to the college during the lean war years as well as providing desperately needed officers to the navy. Enrollments at Tufts dropped precipitously as young men were called to service, and the empty seats were filled with V-12 trainees.</p>
							<p>The Navy V-12 Program was administered by the School for War Service, a division of Tufts established to run that and other wartime programs.</p>
							<p>A memorial to those who participated in the V-12 program was dedicated on September19, 1998. Located near Ballou Hall on the Medford campus, the memorial includes a plaque and bench on a brick terrace overlooking the President's Lawn. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00309"><head>Robert L. Nichols</head></figure>Robert L. Nichols (1904-1995), A1926, H1978, was a noted explorer and geologist who served on the Tufts faculty for forty-five years. His discoveries led to the naming of the Tufts Pass in Antarctica and the Tufts Elv in Greenland. </p>
							<p>Nichols received his bachelor's degree from Tufts in 1926 before moving on to study at Harvard, where he received an M.A. in 1930 and a Ph. D. in 1940. While studying at Harvard, Nichols began his teaching career at Tufts. He served as a lecturer in the Department of Geology from 1929 to 1936, when he was named assistant professor. Nichols was named chair of the department in 1940, and was promoted to full professor in 1946.</p>
							<p>Nichols is most famous for his contributions to research in geologic history in Antarctica and Greenland. He participated in seventeen different expeditions during the course of his life, including five expeditions to Antarctica. In the early 1940s, Nichols discovered a valley and glacier formation in Antarctica, and named it the Tufts Pass in honor of his alma mater. On a similar expedition, Nichols was forced to survive on seal meat for twenty-eight days, after bad weather prevented planes from making food drops for him. In the late 1940s and the early 1960s, Nichols made expeditions to unexplored northern Greenland. The Danish government honored his discoveries in Greenland by naming a river after Tufts in the area Nichols explored. In 1963, Nichols and some of his students were filmed descending into the Grand Canyon. The program was later broadcast on ABC's "Meet the Professor." </p>
							<p>During his lifetime, Nichols was a member of numerous geological organizations, including the American Geographical Society, the Geological Society of America, the Royal Geographic Society, and the Explorer's Club. He received honorary degrees from both Tufts University and the University of Kentucky, and was a recipient of the Tufts Distinguished Service Award in 1948. In 1965, the United States Department of Defense presented him with the Antarctic Service Medal in honor of his contribution to Antarctic science, and in 1978 Nichols received the Bellinghausen-Lazarev Memorial Medal of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow. </p>
							<p>After retiring from his position as Henry Bromfield Pearson Professor of Natural Sciences at Tufts in 1974, Nichols worked briefly as a lecturer at the University of Kentucky. In 1979, the Department of Geology at Tufts established the Robert L. Nichols Scholarship for students showing exceptional ability in geological fieldwork. Nichols died on February 25, 1995, of complications from Alzheimer's Disease.</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS054:MS054.003.DO.02273"><head>AMRAD headquarters in North Hall, ca. 1955</head></figure>North Hall, located on the Medford campus until destroyed by fire in 1972, was the site of the first continuous radio broadcast in the world. Originally built by Harold J. Power, A1914, who received permission from Tufts to locate a private radio research laboratory on the Hill, the building became home to the American Radio and Research Corporation (AMRAD).Power's construction also included a 304 foot antenna. Additions were made to the building as needed, extending the rear of the structure toward Boston Avenue.</p>
							<p>Under the call numbers 1XE, Power broadcast various recorded concerts through a microphone of his own design for three hours in the evening of March 18, 1916.This event marked America's first continuos radio broadcast. After World War I, the station began broadcasting daily, changing its call letters to WGI in 1922. AMRAD claimed that between May 1921 and July 1922, a number of radio firsts took place in the building, including the first daily broadcasts, radio dance programs, university professor lectures, weather broadcasts, and bedtime stories. Following AMRAD's merger with Magnavox, the company vacated the building.</p>
							<p>The structure was briefly used by the Boston Evening Transcript until 1927, when the Department of Electrical Engineering began offering instruction in Radio Engineering, under the supervision of Professor Paul A. DeMars. The building, renamed the Electro-Technical Building was remodeled to provided laboratories, classrooms, offices, and the necessary power supply for the courses. The entire north end of the structure,minus the top floor, was made into a high voltage laboratory, with fire-proof walls, an observation gallery, and a 250,000 volt transformer. As interest diminished, the radio courses were conducted by the Department of Physics. The Department of Electrical Engineering vacated the building, except for the high-voltage laboratory. The antenna had previously been removed.</p>
							<p>The Doble Engineering Company, founded by Frank C. Doble, A1911, expanded to fill the building until 1947, when the college reclaimed the space due to a shortage of classroom facilities. After undergoing additional renovations, which included the removal of the high-voltage equipment, the building, under the designation North Hall, housed the departments of education and psychology. </p>
							<p>In 1915 a series of photographs of the surrounding area were taken from the top of the building's 304 foot antenna.</p>
							<p>North Hall was destroyed by a fire that took place on February 16, 1972.</p>

							<figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.001.093.00001.00952"><head>NROTC Training on Mystic Lakes, ca. 1942</head></figure>
							<p>The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) was established at Tufts in 1942, in order to help train reserve soldiers for duty in the Second World War. </p>
							<p>During the First World War, Tufts established a branch of the Student Army Training Corps because of the need to train a large number of soldiers in a short amount of time. At the end of the war, the Tufts program was rated one of the five most effective in the country. Drawing from this experience, Tufts President Leonard Carmichael suggested that Tufts establish something similar to support American involvement in the new conflict.</p>
							<p>In 1941, Carmichael officially requested the allocation of a Naval ROTC unit to Tufts. Almost immediately, the request was granted, and Tufts became one of the eight colleges to establish an NROTC program during the 1941-42 academic year. The program was headquartered in the old AMRAD wing of <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName>. The program staff consisted of three commissioned officers and a non-commissioned staff. The first of these officers to come to Tufts was Captain C.H.J. Keppler, who had previously been the head of the NROTC program at Brown University. Keppler arrived at Tufts in 1941 to oversee the organization of the program, and was given the title of Professor of Naval Sciences. In 1942, Captain Preston B. Haines became the commander of the Tufts program, a position he held until 1945. </p>
							<p>Originally, enrollment in the program was limited to one hundred freshmen from either liberal arts or engineering. Students took one course each year in the newly established the Department of Naval Science and Tactics. During their schooling, students were classified as V-1, putting them on inactive duty so they could complete their studies. After completing the four-year course, students could then take the appropriate exams and receive commissions as either ensigns in the Naval Reserve, or second lieutenants in the Marine Corps Reserve. Membership in the NROTC was voluntary, but Carmichael was certain that all freshmen males would want to participate. </p>
							<p>The purpose of the NROTC program was to produce technically trained personnel, schooled in wide subject areas. Therefore, Tufts worked to integrate the NROTC program into the rest of the college, allowing NROTC courses to substitute for some requirements, and setting up a Committee for Visitors. </p>
							<p>On July 1, 1943, with the war escalating, Tufts became a host school for the V-12 program, meaning that the campus would now host trainees on active duty. One thousand new trainees arrived on campus, and all of the students already enrolled in the program were switched from V-1 to V-12. The School for War Service was established to administer the program, and by late summer, all of the Tufts NROTC programs were functional. By 1944, Tufts had trained more men directly from civilian life to commissions in the Naval Reserve than any other New England college. </p>
							<p>As the Second World War came to and end, the administration decided that the NROTC should be established permanently at Tufts. The request was approved by the Navy, which at the same time was ending its wartime V-12 programs and switching back to the pre-war NROTC programs. </p>
							<p>In the fall of 1945, with an enrollment quota of 571 students, the NROTC program began its first peacetime year. At first, students had difficulty fulfilling all of the Tufts distribution requirements while taking the NROTC courses, and the administration was forced to set up an alternate degree program. Students participating in the NROTC were awarded a Bachelor of Naval Science degree. Within a year, the Navy had readjusted the program, and none of the new degrees were awarded after 1946. </p>
							<p>For the next few years, the NROTC program continued to expand. In 1949, seeing the popularity of the NROTC unit, an Air Force ROTC program began operation at Tufts. At the same time, Army ROTC programs were in full swing at both the medical and dental schools. During the Korean War, almost seventy percent of the Tufts male population was enrolled in either the NROTC or the AFROTC. In fact, the ROTC population at Tufts had grown so large that in 1952 the trustees voted to construct a building devoted to the ROTC program. The building, Sweet Hall, was opened in 1954, and served as headquarters to the ROTC programs for the rest of their tenure at Tufts. </p>
							<p>Although the early 1950s was one of the strongest periods for the NROTC at Tufts, by 1958, the program was lagging. In order to spark interest in the program, the College of Engineering restructured its requirements so that NROTC courses took the place of the humanities requirement. This caused much controversy, and in 1966, the faculty finally formed a concrete policy, making NROTC courses count as free electives, not humanities courses. </p>
							<p>The program was also in financial trouble. With the cost of college tuition rising, it was becoming more difficult for the Navy to cover all of its trainees' college costs. They reduced the student limit in all of their ROTC programs, prompting objections from college administrators. </p>
							<p>The NROTC and AFROTC programs, through the 1950s, had been quite successful at Tufts, and had not been questioned by non-ROTC students. This all changed with the outbreak of the Vietnam War. The AFROTC program began to face its own problems by 1964. Enrollment was so low between 1964 and 1967 that in 1968, AFROTC officials announced the program would cease operation in 1972, when its current trainees had graduated. The NROTC problem, though facing low enrollment, had enough students to successfully continue. By 1968, however, the NROTC was facing pressure from students and faculty who began to question the place of military institutions on college campuses. </p>
							<p>During the 1968-1969 academic year, much campus discussion focused on the NROTC program. In fact, the disagreements became so intense that on April 16, 1969, administrators cancelled afternoon classes in order to hold a meeting about the future of the ROTC programs. Twenty-five students were allowed into Ballou Hall to argue the matter in front of the entire faculty. A loudspeaker was set up outside to allow the rest of the student body to listen in. After three and a half hours of debate, the faculty put forward the recommendation that the NROTC be discontinued immediately, but that enrolled students should be allowed to complete their programs and graduate. They ignored the AFROTC program because it had already announced its cancellation without student pressure. The vote divided the liberal arts and engineering faculty, as many engineers felt the program was extremely useful, and also angered a large number of Tufts alumni. </p>
							<p>Due to the overwhelming alumni response, the trustees met to discuss the NROTC issue. At first, the faculty recommendation was voted down 9-13. They petitioned the Navy to change the program and make it an extracurricular activity, and found that the Navy had been planning on closing the Tufts program anyway. In December, 1969, taking into consideration the Navy's plans for the program, the trustees upheld the faculty proposal and the program was ended after the final class graduated in 1973. </p>
							<p>The NROTC issue did not remain quiet for long. In the fall of 1976, after a number of student petitions, the faculty voted to allow students to register for ROTC courses at MIT. No Tufts faculty members were involved, and Tufts would not accept ROTC courses for credit. The trustees approved the faculty vote, and Tufts students began training at MIT.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, Tufts still has no ROTC program, but interested students continue to participate through the MIT program. </p>

							<p> The Office of the Provost was created in 1951 after the retirement of George S. Miller from his posts of Vice President and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Tufts College.</p>
							<p>After Miller's retirement, Tufts President Leonard Carmichael decided to further divide up the responsibilities of the administration to coincide with the expansion of the college. The position of provost was created to assume the academic administrative duties covered by Miller when he was Vice President. The new provost was expected to oversee the academic affairs of the institution, especially faculty appointments and curriculum problems. The provost also serves as chair of the Academic Council. </p>
							<p>In 1953, after original provost John P. Tilton was elected Senior Vice President, the position was renamed Senior Vice President and Provost. The change in the title added control over not only the academic and financial affairs of the university, but also made the provost the immediate assistant to and stand in for the president.</p>
							<p>Tilton, the first provost, served from 1951 until his untimely death in 1959. A month later, Leonard Mead was named to the post, and served until 1965. Mead was succeeded by Albert Ullman, who held the position until 1973. After Ullman's retirement, Tufts named Kathyrn McCarthy to the position, making her the first female provost. McCarthy resigned in 1979, citing differences with the administration on the direction of the university. After her resignation, the university conducted a nationwide search for a replacement, and in 1981 hired Tufts professor Sol Gittleman, at the time the chair of the Department of German and Russian Languages. As of 2005, Jamshed Bharucha is the Tufts Provost.</p>

A large barn at the rear of the building housed farm animals and tools, as well as the toilet facilities. In 1885 and 1886 the library was moved from Ballou Hall into the structure, at which point it became known as the Library. The first floor rooms were converted into reading rooms and a curved addition was added on to the back of the building to house the stacks. Students continued to live in the building until 1901. The Library was moved into the Eaton Memorial Library upon its completion in 1908, at which point Packard Hall assumed its current name. From 1910 until 1915, Packard Hall was assigned as temporary quarters for the Crane Theological School, which had been disposessed of Miner Hall by the newly formed Jackson College for women.

He served as minister to parishes in Springfield, Gloucester, and Cambridge before being forced by ill health to abandon the ministry. Thereafter he pursued multiple interests, including serving as town clerk in Cambridge for two terms in the 1840s. He helped to organize the Cambridgeport Bank, for which he later served as Tresurer and a Director. His religious studies were never left behind however, and between 1844 and 1870 he published a six volume "Commentary on the New Testament" which became the standard commentary in the Universalist denomination.</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00327"><head>Paula Frazier Poskitt</head></figure>The Paula Frazier Poskitt Scholarship was established in 1995 by Dr. Thomas R. Poskitt, A1966, M1970, in memory of his wife, Paula Frazier Poskitt, J1966, G1972, to provide tuition support for a senior biology major who intends to pursue graduate studies. </p>
							<p>Paula K. Frazier Poskitt graduated magna cum laude in biology and received an M.A. in developmental biology from Harvard in 1968. While she was a graduate student she worked in the laboratory of Dr. Carroll Williams. She was awarded a Ph. D. from the department of Physiology at Tufts Medical School in 1971, and was accepted as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Louisville from 1971-1974. During the period of her postdoctoral fellowship, she was the first to describe a tumor specific antigen in a nonviral induced animal malignancy and, in collaboration with her husband Thomas, A'66, M'70, characterized an immune complex mediated form of renal disease in the tumor-bearing animals. Subsequent to her postdoctoral fellowship she served on the faculties of Harvard Medical School, New Jersey College of Medicine, and East Tennessee State University, where she and her husband collaborated on numerous research projects in an attempt to delineate the immunologic relationship between tumors and their hosts. She ended her investigative career in 1988 as vice president for research at the Environmental Health Institute in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, an NIH-funded think tank devoted to issues of environmental carcinogens and their effects on the human genome. That same year, at the age of 43, she developed breast cancer and died six years later. The Paula Frazier Poskitt Scholarship in Biology was established by her husband to assist potential young investigators who, as determined by the Department of Biology, have shown uncommon aptitude in basic research and plan on entering graduate school to obtain a Ph. D. in any of the biological sciences. Paula Poskitt devoted her professional career to basic research, and that career was fostered at its inception at Tufts through scholarships and grants. That other future scientists can have that opportunity is the primary reason for the establishment of the Paula Frazier Poskitt Scholarship. </p>

							<head>Pearson, Fred Stark, 1861-1915</head>
							<figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA073:UA073.002.DO.00013"><head>Frederick Stark Pearson, n.d.</head></figure>
							<p>Fred Stark Pearson (1861-1915), E1883, G1884, H1900, H1905, was a highly influential electrical engineer who revolutionized city rail systems and the use of hydroelectric power. The Pearson Memorial Chemistry Laboratories are named for him.</p>
							<p>Pearson was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, on July 3, 1861. Pearson's father died when he was only fifteen years old, leaving his mother to support Fred and his brothers. After his family moved to Medford in 1877, Pearson began work as a station agent at the Medford Hillside railway station, located across from where <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> stands today. While working at the station, Pearson attracted the attention of several Tufts professors, including Professor Amos E. Dolbear, who taught physics and astronomy. Dolbear pressed then-president Capen to allow Pearson into Tufts, and in 1879, Pearson was admitted. He became a special student in chemistry under Professor Stephen Minot Pitman, but transferred to M.I.T. in 1880, hoping to delve even more deeply into chemistry. Pearson returned to Tufts in 1881, completing his schooling over the next two years while working as Postmaster at the Hillside Post Office.</p>
							<p>After graduating in 1883, Pearson was immediately hired as Walker Professor of Mathematics at Tufts for three years. He finished graduate school in 1884, while working as a professor and pursuing personal contracts with various commercial groups. Teaching, however, would prove to be the wrong career choice for Pearson. Although he was an enthusiastic professor, he often moved too quickly in class, leaving slower students behind. After his three years of teaching came to a close, Pearson decided to move on.</p>
							<p>Pearson had become interested in mining during his final year of teaching and decided to explore the possibilities of becoming a mining engineer. He toured Texas and Mexico in search of metal deposits, and traveled to Brazil to survey the chances of developing a gold mine in Sao Paulo. On his return to the United States, Pearson married Mabel Ward, who he had known since childhood. His marriage served as a precursor to yet another career change.</p>
							<p>After his marriage, Pearson, along with fellow Tufts graduate H.C. Buck, founded the Somerville and Woburn Electric Light Companies, and founded a similar business in Wakefield. The companies were some of the first to provide electricity to an entire community using only one power source, and both companies gained much attention and success. </p>
							<p>In 1888, Boston businessman Henry Whitney hired Pearson to work as chief engineer for the West End Street Railway, which incorporated six local horse-drawn railway lines. Whitney had heard of Pearson's electrical expertise, and was attempting to convert his railway to electric power. Pearson was put in charge of the project. Although Whitney's original plan was for a cable drawn system, Pearson scrapped the idea in favor of overhead wires. Within three years, the project was complete and West End Street Railway had become one of the richest companies in Boston. In 1893, Pearson left the company, now a seventeen million-dollar business, and moved to New York to work for the Brooklyn Heights Railway Company. While in New York, Pearson designed two central power plants for the company and organized the Eastern Power Company.</p>
							<p>For the remainder of the 1890s, Pearson continued working with railways and electricity. He began working on a subway system in New York, and also worked in Montreal, St. John, Syracuse, Providence, and Liverpool. After gaining an interest in coal mining, Pearson invented the first machine to carry coal from a railroad car to a vessel. </p>
							<p>At the turn of the century, Pearson decided to commit more time to developing hydroelectric power. In 1899, Pearson moved to Brazil to begin developing a hydroelectric plant to supply power to Sao Paulo. By using the Rio Tiete, Pearson was able to produce more than six thousand horsepower in energy, and transmitted it to Sao Paulo via a twenty-two mile high-tension wire. Pearson then founded a power company in Sao Paulo to regulate the power he developed. By 1905, he would own a similar enterprise in Rio de Janeiro as well. </p>
							<p>While working in Brazil, Pearson had continued to invest in other projects. In 1906, Pearson, using water harnessed from the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, founded the Toronto and Niagara Power Company and developed a twenty-five thousand horsepower plant in Winnipeg. Pearson also financed the construction of power plants and railway systems in Mexico, and built the Medina Dam near San Antonio, which was used to irrigate thirty thousand acres of land. </p>
							<p>Pearson, who was a millionaire by his early thirties, now owned houses in New York and Surrey, England. In 1902, Pearson became enamored with Great Barrington, Massachusetts, buying a thirteen thousand acre property and relocating his family. He would remain in Great Barrington, becoming a major benefactor of the town. </p>
							<p>Pearson's last great project was centered in Barcelona, Spain. Pearson used the Ebro River and its tributaries to provide power to Barcelona and most of the province of Catalonia. The central plant of the system was completed in 1914, but due to the outbreak of World War One, the project was temporarily halted. </p>
							<p>In May of 1915, Pearson was working in New York when he was called to London for a meeting to discuss developments in Barcelona. The only vessel slated to arrive in time for the meeting was the Lusitania, and Pearson booked passage for himself and his wife. On Friday, May 7, 1915, German torpedoes sank the Lusitania, and both Pearson and his wife died. Ironically, Tufts had recently been developing anti-submarine devices, and on Pearson's return, he was to officially present the results of the project. </p>
							<p>Pearson was memorialized at Tufts with the construction of the Pearson Memorial Chemistry Laboratories in 1923, and had been honored prior to his death by honorary degrees in 1900 and 1905. On May 19, 1928, the Rotary Club of Barcelona dedicated a monument to Pearson in honor of his work in bringing power to Barcelona and the surrounding province. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Pen, Paint, and Pretzels, 1910" id="P00009">
							<head>Pen, Paint, and Pretzels, 1910</head>
							<p> Pen, Paint, and Pretzels was founded in 1910 by five members of the class of 1911. The organization's goal was to "encourage dramatic interest at Tufts College by the production of original plays by students or graduates of Tufts or Jackson." Pen was to signify the writers; paint, the artists; and pretzels, the audience.</p>
							<p>Although prior to 1910 there had been a few drama organizations at Tufts, they were short-lived and generally unsuccessful. In the spring of that year, Clifford Amsden, Walston Brown, Harold Gallupe, Charles Gott, and John Libby came together to form Pen, Paint, and Pretzels, designed to be a more permanent organization. With the help of Professor Leo R. Lewis, the five juniors organized auditions and found a stage space in Jackson Gym. Their first production, "Teamwork," written by Gott and Gallupe, premiered December 15, 1910. By 1912, the founders had graduated, but Pen, Paint, and Pretzels had earned enough money to install lighting and dimmers on the Jackson stage, and was also able to purchase costume and scenery materials. Although the organization did not only perform plays by Tufts authors, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels quickly became very popular around campus, playing to full houses and garnering excellent reviews.</p>
							<p>With the outbreak of World War I, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels began to take their performances on the road. They performed at nearby barracks for soldiers, and did benefit shows to encourage the purchase of war bonds. After the war, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels continued to perform charity shows at locations all around New England. In 1921, future Tufts president Leonard Carmichael was elected president of the organization, and in 1924, their performance of "Romeo and Juliet" was broadcast over AMRAD's station, WGI. It was one of the first times a play was broadcast live over the airwaves. </p>
							<p>Since 1915, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels worked closely with the Masque, the drama society of Jackson College. The two groups collaberated on many plays, fundraising and holding auditions jointly. Finally, in 1930, the two organizations merged under the Pen, Paint, and Pretzels name, increasing the organization's membership and funding. Since then, Pen, Paint, and Pretzels has remained a co-ed organization. </p>
							<p>During World War II, Pen, Paint and Pretzels decreased their performances as students concentrated on the war effort. Their performance of "Heavenly Express" in 1941 was interrupted to broadcast Roosevelt's announcement that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor. Immediately following the war, enrollment at Tufts swelled, and demand for seating at Pen, Paint, and Pretzels events greatly increased. For some of its performances, the organization packed up and moved to Pearson Hall in order to accommodate a larger audience. </p>
							<p>In 1948, the Department of Athletics finally vacated Jackson Gym, which was already informally known as the Tufts Theater. The facility was given over to the Department of Drama and Speech, but early in 1949, the stage was condemned, forcing the department to stage plays on a raised oval in the middle of the gym floor. This new setup was the first appearance of an arena theater in New England, and Pen, Paint, and Pretzels productions were photographed for use in "Amerika," a State Department publication about American culture designed for Soviet citizens.</p>
							<p>Pen, Paint, and Pretzels continued to stage its productions in the Tufts Arena Theater until its destruction in 1991. Drama productions were then moved to the Marston Balch Arena Theater, constructed in the Aidekman Arts Center the same year. The new theater contains state of the art lighting and stage equipment, and is named after a former Pen, Paint, and Pretzels faculty advisor. As of 2000, the organization's productions continue to be a popular attraction at Tufts University. </p>

							<head>Peter Belfer Award in Political Science, 1973</head>
							<p>The Peter Belfer Award in Political Science is an academic scholarship award in Arts and Sciences given annually for the outstanding piece of written work done in a political science course or independently by a political science major. This award was established in 1973 by Mrs. Ann Belfer Goldstein, in memory of her husband, Peter Belfer.</p>
							<p>Peter Belfer, A1967, was born on June 28, 1946, in New York City. He began to study the stock market and invest in it at age thirteen. This interest in the market was a dominating theme for the remainder of his life. He graduated from Wheatley High School in three years with distinction and was accepted to several universities. He chose Tufts where he majored in Political Science, and took several courses in Russian politics and economics. While at Tufts, in 1966, Peter met Ann Krasow, an art student. After graduating from Tufts in 1967, he went to Cornell Law School. Peter and Ann were married on June 29, 1969, and honeymooned in Russia.</p>
							<p>Peter excelled in securities law and decided the Securities and Exchange Commission was a good place to start his legal career. In the spring of 1970, serious heart problems began quite suddenly. During the following year he met one physical crisis after another, yet managed to graduate from Law School, begin work for the Securities and Exchange Commission, take the Bar examination for the District of Columbia, and be admitted to the Bar. The day after taking the Bar examination he collapsed. He worked from home until his death on September 5, 1971. He was 25 years old.</p>

Her younger brother Richard had enrolled at Tufts the same year, and her father, Charles Henry Patterson, was himself an alumnus.</p>
							<p>Pierce, a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, studied literature and foreign languages while at Tufts. After graduating, Pierce taught in West Springfield, Massachusetts, before returning to Morgantown. There, in 1915, she married Herbert S. Pierce. Later, the couple moved to Vermont, where Pierce was active in local community affairs. Pierce served as a trustee at Orleans County Hospital and was a member of the Lydonville Daughters of the Revolution and the Fortnightly Club. Pierce died on February 21, 1984, in Vermont. </p>

Power (1892-1969), E1914, organized the American Radio and Research Corporation or AMRAD, which set up one of the first two broadcasting stations in America and was the first to broadcast on a daily schedule. </p>
							<p>Power was born on July 19, 1892, in Everett, Massachusetts. While still in high school, Power developed a strong interest in radio and broadcasting, and worked on numerous ships as a radio operator during his time off. Once at Tufts, Power studied under many of its most eminent scholars, including Professor Hooper of the Department of Electrical Engineering. To pay for his education, Power worked summers as the wireless operator on the liner Saint Louis, and later on J.P. Morgan's yacht "Corsair." After graduating from the School of Engineering in 1914, Power attended graduate school at Harvard University for one year before organizing the American Radio and Research Corporation, or AMRAD. Power negotiated with Tufts and acquired land on the Boston Avenue hillside to build a radio tower and broadcasting station. With financial backing from his old boss J.P. Morgan, Power constructed a 304-foot tower and an accompanying laboratory building on the Tufts hillside. This station was one of the first broadcasting stations in the country, and after a few months in operation, became the first station to broadcast on a daily schedule. </p>
							<p>During World War One, Power began developing products specifically for military use. He designed and manufactured large numbers of transmitters and receivers for the Army, and worked on an electromagnet accepted by the U.S. Navy as the only detector capable of locating a submerged submarine lying idle. AMRAD also pioneered the development of simplified radio receivers and broadcasting service equipment. </p>
							<p>After World War I, Power, in order to expand his business, bought more land and built an AMRAD manufacturing plant. This building later became the Hooper Electrical Engineering Laboratories, and is now known as Halligan Hall.</p>
							<p>In 1930, Power merged AMRAD with Motorola, and sold all the local AMRAD land and facilities to Tufts. In 1948, Power became President and Treasurer of Power's Condenser and Electronics, and there he pioneered development of A.C. electrolytic capacities. Power retired in 1958, having spent forty-three years working with radio and electronics. He died in New Jersey on May 10, 1969. </p>

							<p> Lieutenant Commander Victor A. Prather, Jr. (ca. 1923-1961), A1944, M1952, was a member of the V-12 Program at Tufts and went on to Tufts Medical School. After two years of practice he was called back to the Navy and graduated from flight surgeon school. He spent one year at Miramar Naval Air Station, half of it on air carrier duty in the Pacific, and was then sent to Port Lyantey in Morocco for three years as flight surgeon for the VR24 squadron, which supported the Mediterranean sixth (supply) fleet. He then was attached to "Project RAM" at the Bethesda Naval Research Institute, the precursor of the Mercury program, whose objective it was to develop a space suit.</p>
							<p>Victor Prather was a space hero before there was space flight. Before man walked in space and stepped on the moon, he saw the world from the edge of space, 113,740 feet high. He and his colleague, Commander Ross, rose to this height on May 4, 1961, seated in an open gondola suspended beneath a Strato-Lab balloon of the Office of Naval Research. (This gondola is now in the Naval Air Museum at the Pensacola Naval Station in Florida.) For nine hours their survival depended on their space suits whose actual operating capabilities they were to determine. They were exposed to minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit and air pressures below 0.1 pounds per square inch. The flight was highly successful, but Victor Prather lost his life, inexplicably slipping into the sea while being picked up by Navy helicopters. President Kennedy phoned and then received his widow and her children at the White House to present the Navy's Distinguished Flying Cross awarded to Prather for heroism and extraordinary achievement.</p>
							<p>Lieutenant Commander Victor Prather and Commander Ross are buried at Arlington National Cemetery, adjacent to the tomb of the unknown soldier.</p>
							<p>The Class of 1947 Victor Prather Scholarship was founded in his honor in 1972. </p>

Built in 1857-58 by John P. Marshall, Professor of Natural Philosophy, acting president in 1861, and member of the original faculty of the college, the house remained as his residence until his death in 1901. One of the oldest residences on campus, the house was one of the first two sales of college property to private individuals (the other being the land on which 72 Professors Row is built). </p>
							<p>Marshall House served as faculty housing until 1911, when the house was purchased by Dr. Lee S. McCollister, dean of the Divinity School, who enlarged the house by adding a large living room on its eastern end. He occupied the house until his death in 1941. Dean George S. Miller occupied the house for the next ten years. In 1951, vice-president Nils Y. Wessell made Marshall House his home until he was appointed president of Tufts and moved into the President's House in 1954.</p>
							<p>Vice-president and first provost John P. Tilton lived in the house until his death in 1959, and it was with his residence that the house became known as the Provost's House. Senior vice-president and provost Leonard C. Mead occupied the house following Tilton. In 1968, the next provost, Albert D. Ulman took up residence in Marshall House. His successor, provost Kathryn McCarthy, resided in the house from 1973-1980, when Sol Gittleman, senior vice-president and provost, took up residence in the house upon his appointment as provost.</p>
							<p>As of 2005, the Provost's House is the temporary home of the Department of Music.</p>

							<head>Ralph S. Kaye Memorial Prize, 1947</head>
							<p>The Ralph S. Kaye Memorial Prize was founded in 1947 by members of Omicron Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi as a memorial to Ralph Sumner Kaye, E1937, who died while serving as a lieutenant aboard a destroyer sunk in the naval battle for Okinawa (Gunte) in 1945. It is awarded to a junior or senior who, at the conclusion of two years or more of mathematics courses and irrespective of his/her major field of concentration, demonstrates a favorable combination of proficiency in mathematics and participation in extracurricular activities. </p>
							<p>Lieutenant Ralph Sumner Kaye was born and raised in Brookline, Massachusetts. At Tufts he specialized in the mathematical side of electrical engineering and was elected to the honorary engineering society Tau Beta Psi. He was also a member of Omicron Chapter of Phi Epsilon Pi. In his freshman year he was elected vice president of his class. In 1942, he entered the Navy and was sent overseas in 1943 as a radar operator with a destroyer escort in the Atlantic and Southwest Pacific. He was killed in a battle at Okinawa Gunte in May 1945 when his destroyer was sunk. Only two weeks earlier he had met with his brother David, E1935, who also served in the Navy. </p>
							<p>Because of his particular interest in mathematics, his fraternity chapter commemorated him with a prize in mathematics. The Kaye Prize was first presented in 1947.</p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00884"><head> Curtis Hall and Research Building, ca. 1890</head></figure>The Research Building was constructed in 1895 to serve as a temporary home to the Department of Chemistry. The building survived until 2000, when it was demolished to make room for a new, permanent facility for the Department of Psychology. </p>
							<p>In 1895, in order to expand the laboratory facilities of the Department of Chemistry, the administration approved plans to construct a temporary, one-story laboratory building. The new building was meant to serve only until a permanent structure could be built. Because of its temporary status, it was rather cheaply constructed. Its doors were left over from <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>, and its laboratory tables came from Ballou Hall. The building was a rectangular one-story building with a large basement. The top level housed the chemistry laboratory, as well as department offices, a library, a stockroom, and an area for advanced lab work. The East end of the basement was dominated by a large lecture room. The room was often a source of complaint for students, as the ceiling consisted of exposed pipes, and trains passing by on the neighboring tracks often made it impossible to hear the professor. </p>
							<p>Even though the building was supposed to be temporary, it housed the Department of Chemistry for thirty years. Chemistry finally moved out of the old building after the Pearson Chemical Laboratory opened in 1923. For the next few years, the building was used by a number of departments. The Department of Civil Engineering moved into the lecture room in the basement and converted it to a new low-head hydraulic laboratory, and the Department of Dramatics moved into the old laboratory, using the space to build sets and store materials. </p>
							<p>In 1930, when Goddard Hall was turned over to the Fletcher School, the Department of Music moved into the Research Building. Music took over the top floor of the building, and the entire facility became known as the Music House. </p>
							<p>During the Second World War, the Department of Civil Engineering took over the rest of the basement, after their facilities in <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> were turned into the Navy mess hall. </p>
							<p>After the Department of Music moved to 20 Professor's Row, the Department of Psychology turned the old laboratory into their department headquarters. The building, even then regarded as temporary, housed various faculty offices, as well as animal experimentation facilities; and became known as the Research Building. Members of the department repeatedly requested that a new psychology building be constructed, but for years the request was denied. The department's offices remained split between the Research Building and North Hall, and later between the Research Building and <placeName n="Paige Hall">Paige Hall</placeName>. Finally, in 2000, the administration approved a plan to build a new psychology building. </p>
							<p>Over the summer of 2000, the Research Building was demolished to make way for a new psychology building, which will house both the department offices and laboratory facilities. </p>

							<p><figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00463"><head>Reservoir from College Hall, 1887</head></figure> The Reservoir, or Rez, as it was known by students, was located where the residential quad lies today, to the west of Ballou Hall and the original campus. The Mystic Water Works Reservoir provided water for the surrounding area. A walkway around the perimeter of the Rez was used for running and late-night strolls, and its embankments were popular sites for picnics and outdoor gatherings.</p>
							<p>The Rez was constructed to provide water for Boston, Chelsea, Charlestown, and Somerville. It also provided water for the Medford Cattle Station in North Somerville to water herds prior to their transport to Brighton for slaughter. At first the site was unfenced, but after three neighborhood children drowned there, as well as a scattering of suicides, a wooden fence was constructed. After being repeatedly looted for bonfires, a wire fence was added in 1917. In 1919 an iron fence was built, surviving until the reservoir was dismantled in 1944.Portions of the fence remain on Packard Avenue across from Gifford House and along the west end of Professors Row by the Fletcher field.</p>
							<p>During excavations conducted by the Metropolitan District Commission for an access road to the Rez in 1879 a Native American burial mound was unearthed. Nine skeletons along with various artifacts were found. Students scavenged the site for items which were used by many to decorate their dorm rooms.</p>
							<p>The Rez was periodically drained and cleaned. In one such cleaning in 1905 a .38 caliber revolver was found which was linked to an unsolved area murder.</p>
							<p>The Rez figured prominently in student folklore over the years. It was said that dates made on the Rez could never be broken, and that seniors asking for a date on the top step of the pumphouse could not be refused. According to legend, a scuffle between a senior, at the Rez with his date, and a freshman, resulted in the senior being dumped into the water. The Rez was subsequently declared off-limits to freshmen, a ban that was only partially enforced by the Sword and Shield society, designated keeper of campus traditions. An exception to the ban was the unceremonious dunking of first-year students which took place periodically.</p>
							<p>Between 1914 and 1944 the reservoir's water supply was used for emergency purposes only, and in 1944 was sold to the college for one dollar. The site was promptly drained and the bricks salvaged for use on the Bray Laboratory. Potential uses for the site were debated with leading contenders being the creation of a large swimming pool and skating rink, or a huge football bowl. In 1948 the site was filled in and leveled for use as a parking lot until the construction of Carmichael Hall in the mid 1950s. </p>

							<head>Reverse Panty Raid, 1958</head>
							<p> On May 19 and 20, 1958, Tufts experienced one of the first "reverse panty raids" to hit any college in the country. </p>
							<p>On May 19, 1958, male students held a major panty raid to celebrate the end of the semester. Led by a brass band, almost three hundred male students raided Hodgdon and Stratton. The group then converged on Metcalf Hall, but was met by police. The group dispersed, and order was restored. </p>
							<p>The next morning, at dawn, the females of 3B Hodgdon led a "short shorts" raid in retaliation for the previous night's activity. Carrying a banner that read "We Want Short Shorts," the Jackson students painted the female biological symbol on fraternity doors and stormed dormitories. They set off fire alarms and banged pots and pans, and some even made off with various pairs of "short shorts." The undergarments were hoisted onto sticks as flags of victory. The male population retaliated by dumping trashcans full of water on the invaders, and the police again arrived on the scene. By that time, however, the raid had ended on its own accord, and order was again restored to the Tufts campus. </p>

							<p>Robert L. Nichols, A1926, was inspired to become a geologist by Professor Alfred Lane. He received an M.A. and Ph. D. from Harvard and returned to Tufts in 1929 to join the Department of Geology, initially as an instructor. He retired in 1974. He was an epic explorer, joining or leading seventeen arctic and antarctic expeditions and publishing the results in some 150 abstracts, articles, reports, and books. His awards and memberships in exclusive national and international societies are too numerous to list, but it should be mentioned that among them is a national teaching award in geology. He was also active as an alumnus.</p>
							<p>Nichols left his mark, and the Tufts name, on the territories he explored. The Tufts Elv is a river in Inglefield Land in the northwest of Greenland and was named by the Danish Government in recognition of the explorations by Nichols there. The Tufts Pass is on Alexander Island in Antarctica, and near it is an area named after Robert Nichols himself. </p>

It was named after Charles Robinson, longtime president of the University's Board of Trustees.</p>
							<p>Robinson Hall was originally designed to serve as a permanent home for the departments of the College of Engineering. Its three stories and high basement contained equipment rooms, laboratories, classrooms, offices, and a large technichal drawing room for civil engineering. At first, the building facilities were used mainly for the Department of Electrical Engineering, although the Department of Physics also controlled a portion of the facilities. In 1937, the attic of Robinson was renovated to serve as a radio laboratory, and photo labs and dark rooms were also completed. In 1940, the Department of Electrical Engineering moved its facilities to the newly completed Hooper Laboratories. Mechanical Engineering also used laboratory space in Robinson until the completion of the Bray Laboratories in 1947.After most of the engineering departments had vacated the building, it was renovated to provide more effective facilities for the Department of Physics. By 1950, only the Department of Physics and the Department of Mathematics remained in Robinson Hall. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Robinson Hall houses the offices and classrooms of the Department of Physics and Astronomy.</p>

Rollins (1878-1980), E1901, was professor of electrical engineering, chair of the Department of Electrical Engineering, and acting dean of the College of Engineering. In addition to his academic and administrative responsibilities, Rollinspursued an interest in both photography and in research about the history of the architectual environment of the Medford campus. </p>
							<p>Rollins was born in Lewiston, Maine, on June 1, 1878. Rollins joined Tufts' engineering faculty as an instructor of physics and electrical engineering upon his graduation from the college in 1901. He became assistant professor in 1910 andwas made full professor and chairman of the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tufts in 1928.He served as acting dean of the engineering school from 1927 to 1929, and received the alumni association's Distinguished Service Award in 1948.</p>
							<p>As an undergraduate at Tufts College, Rollins worked on campus assisting with the school's new electrical system, winding transformers and installing lights. He earned fifteen cents per hour for his labor.</p>
							<p>Throughout his tenure at Tufts, Rollins built a full-scale model telephone office, a collection of lamps, wrote a history of the first forty years of electrical engineering at Tufts, and compiled in notebooks a history of buildings and gates on the Medford campus. </p>
							<p>Rollins worked closely with Professor Melville Munro in his activities as campus photographer. Rollins, only a few years Munro's senior, sparked Munro's interest in photography, encouraging him to embark on what was to become an exhaustive photographic history of the college, spanning the entirety of Munro's years at Tufts. Rollins assisted Munro in assembling the scrapbooks and taking photographs.</p>
							<p>Rollins and his wife, Mabel, resided at 84 Packard Avenue for the majority of his years at Tufts. He died in Rockland, Maine, on December 17, 1980, at the age of 102. </p>

							<head>Root, Waverly L., 1903-82</head>
							<p>Waverly Root (1903-82), A1941, a member of the class of 1924, was a noted journalist and food essayist.</p>
							<p>Born in Providence, Rhode Island, on April 15, 1903, Root spent his formative years in Fall River, Massachusetts. He graduated from Durfee High School and entered Tufts College with an interest in English and journalism. First published in a local newspaper at the tender age of thirteen, Root was prepared for a lifetime of writing. Though he left Tufts with only three credit hours remaining, Root turned to what he termed "unskilled labor" and began a long and storied career in journalism. His first post, with the Chicago Tribune, brought him to Paris where he spent the majority of his adult life. At the Tribune his co-workers included such luminaries as Henry Miller and James Thurber. His correspondence abroad, including the last American radio broadcast from France to the U.S. before World War II, earned him the respectful title 'dean' of American international journalists."The Truth About Wagner," published in 1928 and "The Secret History of the War" in 1945 and 1946, his first books, reveal his wide variety of interests.</p>
							<p>In 1941 Tufts granted Root his degree extra ordinem in recognition of his achievements. Furthermore, he received citations for work in the fields of music and international journalism. Yet his next book, in a different field altogether, would be his most popular."The Food of France," his foray into gastronomy, ended his thirty year career in international journalism."The Food" was published in 1958, has yet to go out of print, and cast Waverly Root as a cooking connoisseur. It was a title he bore successfully, publishing several other books in the field and writing numerous newspaper columns. Regrettably, his attempt to enter the field of fiction with the unsuccessful novel "X-Ray Eyes" forever convinced Root to restrict his professional endeavors.</p>
							<p>While a student at Tufts, Root competed with the track and tennis teams, was a member of the band and the mandolin club, played the piano and edited the Tufts Weekly. In his professional life he was president of the Anglo-American Press Association of Paris, vice-president of the Overseas Press Club, and an officer in the Legion of Honor. His first marriage to Jeanne Rose Albinelli in July 1937 produced his only daughter, Diane Lane Root, and his second marriage to Colette Debenais in 1959 lasted until his death. Waverly Root had followed his father, Francis Solomon Root E1900, his mother Florence May Lewis W1899, and his aunt Martha Wonson W1898, to Tufts College. His younger sister Winifred Florence Root J1926 entered Tufts shortly after her brother.</p>
							<p>Waverly Root published his final book "Food" in 1981, and died of a pulmonary ailment in Paris on October 31 of the following year. He was seventy-nine years old.</p>

							<p> Harry Rosener, A1927, was a chemist and entrepreneur who developed a waterproof fabric coating used to replace rubber during World War II. </p>
							<p>Rosener graduated from Tufts in 1927, and began work as a chemist at Middletown Rubber, where he was eventually promoted to Vice President and chief chemist. Besides inventing a waterproof fabric coating, Rosener also designed the first starchless stiff collar, used mainly on men's shirts. </p>
							<p>Rosener served as president of the Connecticut Alumni Club for Tufts, and attended all seventy-two of his class reunions, excepting two during the war. After his retirement from Middletown, Rosener opened Rita Personnel, an employment agency. He died on February 10, 2000, in Portland, Maine. </p>

							<p> Stephen Rushmore (1875-1960) was the sixth dean of the Tufts College Medical School, holding the position for five years, beginning in 1922. </p>
							<p>Rushmore was born in 1875 in Rochester, New York, and spent most of his early life in Plainfield, New Jersey. He received his undergraduate degree from Amherst College in 1897 and his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1902.</p>
							<p>He spent a year teaching during his medical studies and the years following his graduation working in several different hospitals, including John Hopkins' and several in New York. He returned to John Hopkins Medical School as an instructor in gynecology in 1906.The following year he became a house officer at the Boston Lying-In Hospital.</p>
							<p>Rushmore joined the Tufts' Medical Faculty in 1909 as an instructor in gynecology, while holding position at two of Boston's hospitals. He became an associate professor in 1912 and then professor and dean in 1922, replacing the acting dean Frank G. Wheatley.</p>
							<p>Rushmore hoped to make Tufts conform to the Johns Hopkins model of medical education, which would have most likely enabled him to accelerate the development of the school. Unfortunately, he felt that his concerns about the lack of a hospital adjacent to the school, the lack of hospital control, class sizes, and the use of medical school funds to support other schools within the college, were not being addressed by the president or the trustees of the college. As a result of these differences, Rushmore resigned in 1927. He died October 31, 1960,in Bridgton, Maine.</p>
							<p>He was a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society, the American Medical Society and various other local and national medical organizations. Rushmore also held the position of dean on the Middlesex MedicalSchool prior to his retirement. </p>

							<p> Sackler, Dr. Arthur M. (1914-1987), a noted psychologist, medical researcher, and philanthropist, donated the funds used to build the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at the Boston campus of Tufts University.</p>
							<p>Sackler was educated at Heights College of New York University in Brooklyn, where he majored in art history and English drama and minored in biology. After completing his undergraduate career, Sackler continued his education at New York University's Medical School. Upon graduation, Sackler was hired as a resident in psychiatry at Creedmor State Hospital. Soon he was named director of the Institute for Psychobiologic Studies, and he began his work as an editor. Sackler edited the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Psychobiology until he decided, in 1960, to found his own journal. Sackler established the Medical Tribune, which soon circulated to over one million readers in twenty different countries. Sackler also continued his work in the lab, gaining additional fame as the creator of Valium. </p>
							<p>In 1983, Sackler gave Tufts University the largest donation it had received to that date, providing for the construction of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at the Boston campus of the Tufts University Medical School.</p>

							<p> The Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences was established in 1980 as part of then-President Jean Mayer's vision of a "one medicine" approach to the health sciences at Tufts. Coordinating the research and training initiatives at the School of Medicine, the School of Dental Medicine, and the School of Veterinary Medicine, as well as providing advanced education in biomedical sciences, the Sackler School grew out of gifts from Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, Dr. Mortimer D. Sackler, and Dr. Raymond R. Sackler. The Sackler gifts were originally intended to renovate laboratory facilities on the Boston campus, but Mayer spearheaded the effort to create the school, drawing on additional gifts.</p>
							<p>The focus of the school is on research and training in the biomedical field drawing on both clinical and basic science. Ph. D. programs are offered in biochemistry; cell, molecular and developmental biology; cellular and molecular physiology; genetics; immunology; molecular microbiology; neuroscience; and pharmacology and experimental therapeutics.</p>

							<p> The Sawyer House was purchased from Somerville farmer Samuel Teele in 1863. It was named after Packard Professor of Theology and first dean of the Divinity School Thomas Jefferson Sawyer, and originally served as his house on campus. It currently serves as home to the Delta Upsilon fraternity.</p>
							<p>When it was purchased, the Sawyer House was a flat roofed home located in the middle of the old campus, on the western end of Professors Row. In 1875, the house was moved to its current location when Professors Row was expanded to reach Curtis Street. In addition to being moved, the Sawyer House was also remodeled, receiving a pitched roof and an extra floor. Sawyer then took up residency with his family in the newly renovated house. In the 1890's, Professor George Knight married Sawyer's daughter, and moved into house. The building became home to both families, and the Knights would remain there until Professor Knight's death in 1911. In 1917, the Sawyer House became a dormitory for Jackson students, who lived there on a co-op plan. It remained a Jackson dormitory until 1938, when the Sawyer House was sold to the Delta Upsilon fraternity. Delta Upsilon extensively remodeled the house, building a large brick front and leaving only a small wooden section in the rear from the original building.</p>
							<p>Between 1943 and 1947, the Sawyer House was used to house men from a local Navy unit, but was returned to Delta Upsilon in 1948. As of 2001, the Sawyer House continues to serve as home to the Delta Upsilon fraternity. </p>

							<p>Sawyer was born in Reading, Vermont, on January 9, 1804. At nineteen, he attended Chester Academy and then Middlebury College, teaching school while finishing his studies. Following his graduation in 1829, Sawyer, determined to enter the Universalist ministry, began studying theology with a Reverend Balch in Winchester, New Hampshire. Due to considerable previous preparation, Sawyer was ordained within a month by the General Convention of New England. During this time he first expressed his determination in the building of a denominational school.</p>
							<p>In 1830, Sawyer took charge of a small congregation in New York City. The following year he married Caroline M. Fisher, with whom he had seven children. In 1831, he also became editor of the "Christian Messenger."Sawyercontinued to preach in New York City, keeping his church open during the cholera epidemic of 1832, until 1845 when he accepted the position of principal of the Clinton Liberal Institute in Oneida County. Sawyer helped organize the Universalist Historical Society, of which he served as secretary and librarian, collecting over three thousand volumes for its collection.</p>
							<p>Sawyer, citing the educational needs of the denomination, called for a convention in New York City in 1847. The outcome of this Universalist meeting was the founding of Tufts College, along with the Canton Theological School and St. Lawrence University. Sawyer served as the president of the first board of Trustees of each of these institutions.</p>
							<p>He continued his work and preaching in New York until 1869 when hewas called to take charge of the newly established Tufts Divinity School as the Packard Professor of Theology. He was formally made dean of the school in 1882.He retired from active work as an instructor, as a result of failing eyesight in 1884, and in 1892, was made professor emeritus.</p>
							<p>Sawyer was twice elected president of Tufts, but declined both times. In 1895, the college conferred a degree of LL.D. on Sawyer. He was also made an honorary member of the college's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Sawyer died at his home on Professors Row on August 5, 1899, as a result of old age. </p>

							<head>School Colors, 1876</head>
							<p> The school colors of Tufts University are brown and blue. The shade of brown is generally called chocolate brown, and the blue is variously described as between light and middle blue, or dusty sky blue. Though this color combination was chosen by the student body in 1876, the colors were not made officially the colors of Tufts University until 1960, when the Trustees voted on the matter.</p>
							<p>In Tufts' early years, a cherry-red color was informally used as the school color, but this was felt to be too similar to Harvard's crimson. In 1876, the undergraduates decided to settle the issue by establishing the colors once and for all. In the ensuing discussions two factions emerged, one favoring seal brown and pearl white, the other, seal brown and gold. Blue was settled on as a compromise, though no specific shade of blue was singled out.</p>
							<p>The first yearbook, published in 1878, was titled "Brown and Blue" and used the chocolate brown and sky blue combination that is in use today.</p>
							<p>Over the years a number of attempts were made to standardize the exact shade of each color to be used but little headway was made. When the Trustees discussed and voted on the issue, the colors were designated according to the color scale of the Athletic Association of America, namely Athletic 6 (brown) and Athletic 40 (blue). </p>

							<head>School of Dental Medicine, 1899</head>														
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA020:UA020.003.DO.00008"><head>Dental school exterior, ca. 1973</head></figure>Tufts School of Dental Medicine came into existence 1899 with the acquisition of the Boston Dental College by Tufts. For a number of years prior to Tufts' acquisition of the school, students at the Boston Dental College were able to enroll in first-year science courses at the Tufts Medical School. When, for a number of reasons, the Boston Dental College faced insurmountable difficulties in supporting its curriculum as desired by the faculty and trustees of that institution, overtures were made to Tufts and the union was made in short order. By the resulting agreement, Tufts acquired the assets, materials, facilities, and human resources of the Boston Dental College, which became the foundation on which the School of Dental Medicine was built.</p>
							<p>The Boston Dental College was established in 1868 in quarters on Tremont Street in Boston. By 1880 the College had graduated 152 students. The curriculum placed considerable emphasis on the interrelationships between medicine and dentistry, with half of the professors holding medical degrees and a course of study requiring anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry, therapeutics, and dissection.</p>
							<p>Upon its creation in 1899, the School of Dental Medicine operated in close coordination with the Tufts School of Medicine. Harold Williams, dean of the medical school, was appointed dean of the dental school, and several faculty held joint appointments in both schools. Close instructional ties were maintained between the medical and mental schools. Basic science classes were taught to medical and dental students separately but by the same faculty. For many years the medical and dental schools shared the same dean.</p>
							<p>By 1912, the Dental School was the twelfth largest in the United States, and its graduates had attained the highest percentage of successful examinations - with a less than five percent failure rate - of any school before the state Boards of Examiners.</p>
							<p>The absence of an endowment presented ongoing difficulties, with little funding available to support research or scholarships. Tuition revenues served as the main source of income for the school.</p>
							<p>Admission required a high school education until 1921, when criteria were changed and one year of college work was required. To addressthe problem of underprepared entering students, a pre-dental program was established at Tufts in1921 to bring Tufts into line with the requirements of accrediting agencies. In 1927, in response to continued outside criticism of the pre-dental program, and its pre-medical counterpart, admission requirements were raised again to the level of a bachelor's degree and both preparatory programs were phased out, with the last students completing the course in Spring 1929.</p>
							<p>The dental school's course of study was three years, though expanded to four years in 1900.It has remained a four year curriculum except in the 1970s when a three year course of study that enrolled students year-round was tried. It was discontinued in 1981.</p>
							<p>The school confers the degree of Doctor of Dental Medicine (D.M.D.).As of 1998, the school had granted a total of 9,434 doctoral degrees.</p>
							<p>The dental school moved with the medical school to the new building constructed for the purpose on Huntington Avenue in 1900, and subsequently to the current downtown Boston location. The School of Dental Medicine is located at One Kneeland Street on Tufts' Boston campus in a facility constructed to house the school in 1973. </p>

							<head>School of Medicine, 1893</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00500"><head>Medical/Dental Building (1901)</head></figure>The Tufts University School of Medicine was voted into existence by the Trustees on April 22, 1893. It was formed by the secession of seven faculty from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston, a school which was formed in 1880.These "original seven" faculty members successfully lobbied to establish a medical school under the auspices of Tufts College. </p>
							<p>The "original seven" first faculty of the Medical School were William Chipman, Henry W. Dudley, Walter L. Hall, John W. Johnson, Albert Nott, Charles P. Thayer, and Frank Wheatley. All had been members of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, but had been dissatisfied with the operations of that institution since it opened in 1880.They believed that in order to raise the standards of the school and provide for the necessary laboratory and clinical work, the school should affiliate with a college or university. President Capen was sympathetic to the idea of Tufts expanding into the realm of medical education, leading the group to concentrate their efforts on affiliation with Tufts.</p>
							<p>The new school, which was designated the Medical School of Tufts College, opened its doors in October 1893 with a student body of eighty students. The school was, from the very beginning, coeducational, and of the twenty-two students who graduated that first year, eight were women.</p>
							<p>The medical school was initially located on three floors of a building at 188 Boylston Street in Boston, now the site of the Four Seasons Hotel. The building, which had formerly served as the home of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, was owned by Tufts as an investment property, and was taken for use of the medical school upon its formation. As enrollment increased rapidly in the first years of the school's operation, the school acquired additional facilities for use in the area. By 1897 the school's growth forced it to seek a new facility. A renovated Baptist church on Shawmut Avenue became the school's new home, but the establishment of the Dental School in 1899 meant that another move was necessary. This time a building was constructed to house both schools on Huntington Avenue, which served as the Medical School's home until 1949, when it moved to its current location on Harrison Avenue in downtown Boston.</p>
							<p>By 1905, the medical school was the largest such school in New England, with a faculty of 105 and 403 students. While enrollments continued to climb, growth of the school was hindered by the lack of any substantial endowment and the failure to obtain a hospital for exclusive use of the school's clinical training needs.</p>
							<p>In the first decades of the medical school's existence there was ongoing concern about admission requirements and the implications these held for the quality of medical education and graduates of the program. Initially, a high school degree from an approved school, or examination in high school subjects was required for admission. Many felt this to be too lax, but others were hesitant to require a full college degree for admission, believing that this would put an unnecessary financial and time burden on students. However, as the American Medical Association criteria for ranking medical schools continued to be revised, admissions standards were gradually increased to a bachelor's degree by the 1932-33 academic year.</p>
							<p>In 1929 an alliance was formed between Boston Dispensary, the Floating Hospital for Infants and Children, and medical school and dental school, constituting the basis for the formation of the New England Medical Center (NEMC) in 1930.This served as the impetus for the medical and dental schools to move from the Huntington Avenue location to downtown Boston. However, before this could take place it was necessary to raise funds to construct a new facility, a task which was made all the more challenging in that it was undertaken in the depression years of the 1930s.</p>
							<p>During World War II, the medical school went on a full-year, accelerated academic calendar to meet the increased wartime demand for medical personnel. Plans continued to go ahead for construction of a new facility downtown, and the move was accomplished in 1949.This move signified the realization of the school's long-term goal of providing close affiliation with a hospital facility for its students.</p>
							<p>Expanding curricular programs and departments to keep apace with the growing medical field placed ongoing strains on the finances of the Medical School. With the majority of income being generated by tuition revenues, since the 1950s efforts have been intensified to seek additional public and private grant funding for projects and to drastically increase the school's endowment. Faculty were successful in obtaining funding from sources such as the Ford Foundation, the National Public Health Service, and the National Cancer Institute. In 1975-76, Professor William B. Schwartz, chair of the Department of Medicine, became the first holder of the Vannevar Bush University Professorship, the first endowed professorship in the university's history. </p>
							<p>For much of its history, the medical school has drawn its student body largely from the New England states. Since the 1950s this has gradually changed, with slightly less than half of entering students in 1999 coming from the six New England states. </p>

							<head>School of Nutrition Science and Policy, 1981</head>
							<p> The Tufts University School of Nutrition Science and Policy was established in 1981 under the leadership of then-president and renowned nutritionist Jean Mayer. The school was founded with the mission of bringing together biomedical, social, political, and behavioral scientists to conduct research, educational, and community service programs to improve the nutritional health and well-being of populations throughout the world.</p>
							<p>Tufts' involvement in the field of nutrition began in the early days of the School of Medicine with the establishment of a food clinic at the Boston Dispensary. In 1918, the Frances Stern Nutrition Center was established for the training of nutritionists. The Stern Center also provided nutrition services to the New England Medical Center hospitals. Academic aspects of the program were coordinated through the Department of Education on the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>The School of Nutrition began as an Institute established in 1976 in Medford, intended to provide for the interdisciplinary study of nutrition issues. The curriculum drew from the course offerings of Arts and Sciences, Fletcher, and the School of Medicine.</p>
							<p>The school opened its doors in 1981 with Stanley N. Gershoff as dean. Gershoff, formerly a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, had served as director of the Institute of Nutrition. From its first class of seventeen students, the School of Nutrition Science and Policy has matured to a student body of 178 students in 2000, representing twenty-seven countries. Master of science and doctoral degree programs are offered in the social and biological sciences. Specialized training programs are available for physicians pursuing doctoral degrees in human nutrition and graduates of bachelor degree nutrition programs who wish to become registered dieticians.</p>
							<p>Interdisciplinary programs involve faculty and scientists at all of the other seven schools at Tufts, including specialty concentrations in international food and nutrition; nutrition communications; agriculture, food and environment; and clinical nutrition, health promotion and disease prevention. </p>
							<p> Faculty at the school include anthropologists, biomedical scientists, economists, nutritionists, epidemiologists, physicians, political scientists, and psychologists focussingon a myriad of issues with the common thread of nutrition and its role in understanding and fostering the growth and development of human populations.</p>
							<p>The school's concern with the problems of hunger and malnutrition in the United States and abroad is reflected in the research and applied work being done by its faculty and students. Areas of specialty include the socioeconomic parameters of malnutrition, nutrition program design and implementation, social marketing and development policy. Graduates of the programs in these areas are employed in government and non-governmental agencies as well as private voluntary organizations throughout the world and in the United States.</p>
							<p>The school is closely affiliated with the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, located on the Boston campus. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01217"><head>Large Animal Hospital, Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, n.d.</head></figure>The School of Veterinary Medicine was established in 1978, opened in 1979, and graduated its first class in 1983.Established through the advocacy of President Jean Mayer, the school was unique in its affiliation to a health sciences complex rather than to a school of agriculture. The school is located on a 634 acre campus in Grafton, Massachusetts, site of a former state mental hospital. The school also shares facilities with the medical and dental schools on the downtown Boston campus, where vet students receive their first year of instruction in the basic sciences. Students at the veterinary school are exposed to care of all types of animals including food (cattle, sheep, swine, goat), fiber (sheep, llama), companion (dog, cat), and sporting (horse) animals. In addition, students are given the option of learning about care for wildlife through the wildlife medicine program. In addition to medicine, surgery, preventive medicine, and public health, the school also educates students about ethics, conservation medicine, and human-animal relationships.</p>
							<p>Initial discussions on the establishment of a veterinary school were begun in the early 1970s as the absence of such a school in the New England region combined with a prediction of a nationwide deficit of veterinarians made the need apparent. After a variety of options were explored, including locating a school at the Otis Air Force base on Cape Cod, Tufts, under Jean Mayer's leadership, stepped forward to take the lead in the project. Richard B. Talbot, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University was brought in as interim dean to oversee the startup of the school on a part-time basis. On April 29, 1978, the trustees voted to establish the school as part of Mayer's vision of an integrated "one medicine" program embracing the totality of medical, dental, veterinary, and nutrition education.</p>
							<p>The school provides clinical facilities as part of the Tufts-New England Veterinary Medical Center, which includes the Foster Hospital for Small Animals, the Large Animal Hospital, the Cornelius Thibeault Equine Clinic, the Amelia Peabody Pavilion, the Issam Fares Equine Sports Medicine Program, the Harrington Oncology Program, and the Wildlife Clinic at Grafton, as well as the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, and the Ambulatory Farm Clinic based at Woodstock, Connecticut.</p>
							<p>The degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.) is the primary degree offered by the school, though since 1995 the school also offers a Master of Science (M.S.) in Animals and Public Policy. The school features several signature programs which offer specialized perspectives on veterinary sciences, including Wildlife Medicine, Equine Sports Medicine, International Veterinary Medicine, Ethics and Values in Veterinary Medicine, and Biotechnology and Veterinary Medicine.</p>

							<p> The Tufts Science and Technology Center was completed in 1990, and serves as a home to the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Electro-Optics Technology Center, the High Energy Physics department, and the Condensed Matter Physics department. </p>
							<p>Tufts University purchased the building that would later hold the Science and Technology Center in 1986. The building, located at 4 Colby St., had been home to the ACME Printing Company, and was a hold over from Medford's industrial days. After purchasing the building, Tufts received a $10 million grant from the US Department of Energy to transform the warehouse into a state-of-the-art facility. The grant required that the building design would incorporate new energy saving techniques, and would experiment with innovative energy savers. Along with the government grant, Tufts received a one million-dollar grant from Kenneth Richardson, E1952, and his wife Constance Rogers Richardson, J1952.Their grant funded the construction of a fully equipped conference center inside the facility. The university's budget surplus also provided some of the funds necessary to complete the $13.3 million project. </p>
							<p>In January, 1989, the Medford Community Development Planning Board finally approved the Tufts proposal to renovate the old factory, on the condition that Tufts conduct a traffic study and fund road improvements in the area. In February, construction on the building finally started. Completion of the project was slated for early summer, 1990, but the renovations were not completed until the beginning of September. The renovated center contained two thirty-three-seat classrooms, an auditorium, the conference center, state of the art laser labs, and research facilities for students and faculty. The two-story, 89,000 square foot center vastly increased the amount of space devoted all of the programs it housed, and also opened up space in the old engineering buildings.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, the Sci-Tech Center, as the building is known around campus, continues to house offices, classrooms, and advanced labs for scientific study. </p>

							<p> Sigma Kappa, Omicron Chapter, was a sorority located on the Medford Campus. In the spring of 1956, the sorority pledged two African-American students into their organization. Following this action, the national Sigma Kappa organization voted to remove Omicron Chapter's charter, "for the good of the Sorority as a whole."Though no formal reason was given, the national organization revoked Cornell University's chapter's membership at the same time, following their decision to pledge an African-American student.</p>

Jeffers, Dean of Women for Jackson College, was chosen by Omicron Chapter to represent their interests to the media and the world at large. In this capacity, Dean Jeffers testified before the Massachusetts House of Representatives in their investigation of the matter, and won the commendation of the House for Tufts' decision to fully support the sorority in its decision to open itself to members of other racial and ethnic groups. Dean Jeffers also fielded correspondence from college administrators from around the country voicing opinions for and against Sigma Kappa's decision, steadfastly defending the decision of the students.</p>
							<p>Following their expulsion from the national chapter, the Tufts Sigma Kappa sorority reconstituted itself, with all of the same members, as a local sorority called Thalia. Thalia Sorority remained in existence until it was disbanded in 1960. </p>

He was deeply involved in choosing the site for the school's campus, as well as selecting Tufts' first President, Hosea Ballou 2nd. Furthermore, until his departure to Illinois in 1857, he served as General Agent of the College. And, from 1851 until his death a decade years later he sat as a member of the Board of Trustees. A memorial plaque, designed by Henry Hering, was placed in Ballou Hall in 1941.It reads:<quote rend="blockquote">TO THE MEMORY OF OTIS AINSWORTH SKINNER D D 1807-1861 HE RAISED THE FUNDS TO ESTABLISH TUFTS COLLEGE AND SERVED AS THE FIRST SECRETARY OF THE TRUSTEES, WAS INFLUENTIAL IN CHOOSING THE SITE AND SELECTING A PRESIDENT, IN DEVISING A PLAN FOR COLLEGE BUILDINGS, AND WAS APPOINTED TO SUPERINTEND THE ERECTION OF THIS BUILDING AND TO PREPARE THE COLLEGE GROUNDS</quote>

							<p>Skinner was born on July 3, 1807, in Royalton, Vermont. Following his common-school education he taught as a teenager and became an itinerant preacher at nineteen. Age twenty-one found him transferred to New Hampshire and preaching part-time. From New Hampshire he moved among parishes: first to Woburn, Massachusetts, and then to Baltimore, Maryland where he edited the Southern Pioneer. In 1837 he became minister of the Fifth Universalist Society in Boston, and from 1846 to 1848 was minister of the Orchard Street Church in New York City. In 1848 he agreed to raise the subscription to fund Tufts College, and returned to the Fifth Universalist Church in Boston, where, as a contemporary describes, he "accomplished his life's work" and "developed a symmetry of character worthy of all acceptation."</p>
							<p>In 1853 he received an honorary degree from Harvard. In 1857 he departed, with his brothers, to Elgin, Illinois, where he soon became president of Lombard College. Though he lacked a higher education, he overcame his lack of qualifications with spirit and drive. His contemporaries praised his work at Lombard: he "possessed an indomitable energy" and, "How inspiring his presence to teacher and pupil!"As can be deduced from the vast number of memorials, obituaries, and articles, Otis Ainsworth Skinner was one of the most prominent Universalist clergymen of his lifetime.</p>
							<p>Several descendants of Otis Ainsworth Skinner are associated with the Tufts community. Otis Skinner H1895 was the first actor to receive an honorary degree from Tufts, while his daughter Cornelia Otis Skinner H1935 received the same honor forty years later. Clarence R. Skinner H1945 served as Dean of Crane Theological School from 1933 until 1945. Dorothy Durant Skinner attended Jackson from 1942 to 1943, Dorothy May Skinner J1952 graduated magna cum laude in Biology. Edna E. Skinner was a special medical student from 1899 to 1900, Eugene Carroll Skinner took classes from 1859 to 1861.George Donald Skinner attended the medical school from 1927 to 1928, as did Ralph Douglas Skinner from 1899 to 1903.Several others attended Tufts, but they are too many to list.</p>
							<p>The Reverend Otis Ainsworth Skinner was an exceptionally active individual, and one writer strongly believed the Reverend literally wore himself out. He died on September 18, 1861, in Naperville, Illinois, while holding an exchange pastorate at the age of fifty-four.</p>

							<head>Smokers, 1860-1965</head>
							<p> Smokers began as social events for male students in the early years of Tufts College. Soon after the founding of the college, various campus groups began holding smokers in order to better the social life of Tufts undergraduates. The smokers were large social events featuring music, speeches, food, and, of course, smoking. </p>
							<p>After the construction of Goddard Gymnasium in 1883, students began to hold large-scale annual smokers on the gymnasium floor. Early annual smokers included the freshman class smoker and the Inter-Fraternity Council smoker. The freshman class smoker served as an opportunity to develop unity among the male freshman, and also helped introduce members of the class to their peers. The Inter-Fraternity Council smoker introduced students to different fraternities in order to help them choose a fraternity to pledge. Each event was quite gala, with banners decorating the gymnasium and students attending in formal dress.</p>
							<p>Over time, smokers developed into more informational gatherings. By the 1950's, mixers had taken the place of smokers as the main social event on campus. Smokers had evolved into information sessions rather than purely social gatherings. By the 1960's, for example, the Inter-Fraternity Council smoker was a Sunday afternoon event that allowed freshmen to visit each fraternity house prior to rush week. Instead of a social gathering with speeches and musical performances, freshmen visited each fraternity and had their pledge cards signed by members of each house. By then, even the Leonard Carmichael Society was holding smokers to introduce interested students to the different community service programs available through their organization. </p>
							<p>By the late 1960's students no longer called any of their gatherings smokers. Although the event had evolved with the times, smokers dropped out of Tufts history, to be replaced by information sessions, fairs, and open houses. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="South African Divestment, 1977-1991" id="S00022">
							<head>South African Divestment, 1977-1991</head>
							<p> Tufts University's investments in companies dealing in South Africa became one of the most volatile issues on campus from the late seventies through the late eighties. From the first news item documenting Tufts investments in 1977 to Jean Mayer's call for reinvestment in 1991, protest and controversy between students, faculty and administration surrounded the issue of South African investments. </p>
							<p>In 1977, during a routine disclosure of Tufts investments, students noticed that the university held about six million dollars of stock in companies doing business in South Africa, at the time ruled by the racist apartheid regime. Tufts stock included holdings in IBM, which was designing computers to help the South African government trace the whereabouts of black workers, and Mobil Oil Corp., who had broken international sanctions by providing oil to Rhodesia though South African ports. </p>
							<p>Soon after the financial disclosure, the death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko at the hands of South African police re-ignited protests against the South African regime. Due in part to the increased awareness of South African government policies and actions, the Tufts Trustees issued a statement in October of 1977 dealing with their South African investments. The statement set guidelines for the invested corporations, calling for "respect for human dignity," and also calling on companies to contribute to the economic welfare of all the people in South Africa. </p>
							<p>Almost immediately following the trustees' statement, all of the companies in question agreed to follow the newly developed Sullivan Principles. The guidelines, developed by Minister Leon Sullivan, set standards for companies doing business in South Africa, calling for non-segregation in all facilities, equal pay, and the increased promotion of black workers. Students at Tufts, however, felt this wasn't enough. In January of 1978, students created the Tufts Committee for South African Divestment (TCSAD), designed to directly protest Tufts investment in South Africa. In February, Tufts divested from Citicorp after finding it had been loaning money directly to the South African government, and on March 7, the first of numerous discussions between trustees and TCSAD occurred during a public forum. Trustees claimed that complete divestment would ruin Tufts' financial portfolio. For the next two months, the trustees held this stance, even after an April 29 protest outside of a major trustees meeting. </p>
							<p>The fall semester of 1978 saw continued protest. On October 18, 1978, eighty students marched in a candlelight vigil calling for divestment. The group chanted and sang in front of President Mayer's house for over an hour, and also dropped off a petition signed by students and faculty calling for divestment. They argued that the Sullivan Principles were inadequate because they did not challenge South African law, and pointed out that the U.N. had called for all of its member countries to divest from companies doing business in South Africa. </p>
							<p>On January 23, 1979, an Advisory Committee on University Investments recommended that Tufts divest itself of all South African holdings by June 1, 1980, and in February the TCU Senate also voted to divest. In May, Tufts announced a plan to partially divest, and in October divested from two companies who had not complied with the Sullivan Principles. The partial divestment policy managed to calm campus protests, but the issue again came to the forefront of university life in the fall of 1985.</p>
							<p>On November 20, 1985, 100 students marched on Ballou Hall to protest continued investment in companies doing business in South Africa. The protest managed to rekindle interest in the issue, and in February of 1986, the TCU Senate sponsored a referendum about divestment for students and administrators. President Mayer, with the support of the trustees, declared that Tufts policy wouldn't change. He said that without international support, US opposition wouldn't change anything, and also that disinvestment, where corporations remove their operations from South Africa, would be more effective. At the close of the referendum, sixty percent of those in attendance voted to divest by May 1987, but Mayer reiterated his opposition to any change in policy.</p>
							<p>Hoping for more exposure among alumni and Tufts benefactors, students held a large scale protest at the February 21, 1986, opening of the Sackler Center, and then picketed outside of a trustees meeting in Cabot the next day. Protests continued during the spring, and in April, students built a shanty on the academic quad symbolizing the shantytowns South African blacks were forced to live in. On April 15, ninety-five students attended another rally outside of the president's house. </p>
							<p>During the summer of 1986, the trustees voted to divest from any company with a low Sullivan rating, and in September they sold one million dollars worth of stock from two companies that hadn't signed the Sullivan Principles. In a statement released to the press, the trustees claimed that the stock was sold for purely economic reasons. Such sparring continued through the fall of 1986 and through most of 1987. In October of 1988, a petition signed by 1600 members of the Tufts community called for immediate and complete divestment, and finally, on February 25, 1989, the trustees unanimously voted to divest completely. </p>
							<p>The trustees' statement cited the fact that their partial divestment policy wasn't bringing about the desired social change. They sold $6.7 million worth of stock, retaining only media stocks and minimal presence operations, such as airlines with only a few personnel on the ground in South Africa. </p>
							<p>Although this should have been the end of the divestment controversy, protest again surfaced in September of 1991, when President Mayer called for reinvestment as apartheid was beginning to be dismantled. A number of brief protests followed, but soon the issue was cleared up, and eventually, Tufts did reinvest in companies dealing in post-apartheid South Africa. </p>

							<head>Spring Fling, 1980</head>
							<p> Spring Fling is a weekend-long celebration held every April on the Medford Campus. Spring Fling events include a comedy show, block parties, and a concert held on the President's Lawn. </p>
							<p>Spring Fling was held for the first time in 1980, when the TCU Senate discovered a large budget surplus at the end of the year. The senate decided to spend the money on a university wide celebration to mark the end of the year. The first Spring Fling, somewhat more tame than those to come, included a SPIRIT picnic, a farewell address from departing Dean Bernie Harleston, a concert on the President's lawn, and the Jumbo Stampede, a ten kilometer road race through Medford and Somerville. Organizers also set up and ran twenty-two seminars on contemporary subjects, held outside on a Friday afternoon. Tufts Day Care also participated, holding a flea market on the library roof, and AppleJam and WMFO brought Zion Initiative to campus for a smaller concert. </p>
							<p>Over the years, Spring Fling has grown to include more recognized bands and many more students. A Thursday comedy show, which has featured such nationally known acts as Bobcat Goldthwait and Jim Breuer, was added to the celebration in 1982. </p>
							<p>Although generally a successful and popular event, Spring Fling has experienced its share of problems. In 1984, five non-Tufts students were arrested at the concert for public drunkenness and fighting. In 1985, to combat such problems, the President's Lawn was fenced off, and students were required to present identification before entering. Also, consumption of alcohol at the concert was regulated, with students allowed only one six-pack of beer each. In previous years, kegs had been set up on the lawn, and alcohol consumption was widespread. </p>
							<p>In 1986, Spring Fling experienced its first major weather setback. Due to rainy weather, the concert was moved to Nine Lansdowne, a nightclub near Kenmore Square. As a result, attendance was poor, because students did not want to commute to see the concert. Since then, a large tent has covered the stage at Spring Fling, and Cousens Gym now serves as the rain location. As of 2000, Spring Fling remains the most popular student event on campus. The annual concert attracts thousands, and the weekend gives students a chance for a last fling before final exams begin.</p>

							<p> Edwin Augustus Start (1863-1923), A1884, through his appointment to the faculty, established Tufts College's History Department in 1892.</p>
							<p>The son of the Tufts College bursar, Reverend W. A. Start, A1862, Start was born in North Bridgewater (now Brockton), Massachusetts, on June 1,1863. He studied at schools in Melrose and Cambridge, Massachusetts, before graduating from Cambridge High School in 1880.Start entered Tufts College the following fall. As an undergraduate, Start was active in student organizations, won prizes in oratory, and served as editor-in-chief of the "Tuftonian" and the "Shield," a Theta Delta Chi fraternity publication.</p>
							<p>After receiving his B.A. from Tufts in 1884, Start settled on a career in journalism. In 1885, he married his first wife, Julia Edith Moore. For several years, Start edited and managed local New England and New York newspapers. Following the death of his wife in 1892, he spent some time in Virginia carrying out historical research.</p>
							<p>In May 1892, he returned north and was appointed Instructor in History at Tufts, formally establishing the department. In 1893, he proposed a curriculum for the new department, which was accepted by the faculty, while working to modify entrance exams to encompass a wider range of subjects. Start also carried out graduate studies at Harvard, receiving his M.A. in 1893. Among his professional and academic organization affiliations, Start was one of the sixteen founding members of the Delta Chapter of Massachusetts of Phi Beta Kappa, and served as its marshal. </p>
							<p>Start was made Assistant Professor of History in 1897. He held the position until 1900, when a controversy arose over Reverend Edwin Bolles joining the faculty as Dickson Professor of English and American History, which had been specifically endowed for Bolles. Start resigned his position on the Tufts' faculty and became director of Extension Work of the University of Washington in 1912. He held that position until his sudden death, following a bout of pneumonia, on October 3, 1923. His second wife, Carrie Knowles, survived him. </p>
							<p>Start House, located at 15-17 Latin Way, was built in 1894 by Start as his private residence, and is named in his honor. </p>

Warren Stearns, n.d</head></figure>Albert Warren Stearns (1885-1959), A1906, M1910, H1943, served as the seventh Dean of the Tufts College Medical School from 1927 to 1935.He was the first Tufts alumnus to hold that office.</p>
							<p>Stearns was born on January 26, 1885 in Billerica, Massachusetts. He attended public schools there, leaving to work in a hardware store shortly before his high school graduation. In 1905, he met a member of the Tufts staff who persuaded him to enter the college. He arrived at <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName> for the start of the academic year with his neighbor and fellow Tufts student, Michael Neson, in a horse-drawn carriage, piled high with furniture. After graduation, Stearns decided to attend Tufts Medical School, expressing interest in the neurological sciences. He received his medical degree in 1910. In 1911, he became a resident at Danvers State Hospital, moving the following year to Boston State Hospital. Also in 1912, he married Frances Matsell Judkins, with whom he had two children. </p>
							<p>By 1913, Stearns was practicing neurology and psychiatry and, from 1923 to 1927, served as consultant to the US Naval Hospital in Chelsea, MA.He returned to the Medical School in 1927 as a professor of psychiatry and dean of the school, a position he held until 1945, when he became a professor and chairman of the Department of Sociology in Arts and Sciences for ten years. From 1929 to 1933, Stearns served as commissioner of the Department of Correction of Massachusetts. He also acted as associate commissioner of the Department of Mental Diseases for the state from 1935 to 1945.He served in both world wars in the Medical Corps of the US Navy and was on leave for that purpose from 1942 to 1945. He held prominent positions in several psychiatric and medical organizations. He authored a number of works, including "Personality of Criminals," published in 1932.In 1945, Tufts awarded him an honorary degree of Doctor of Science. Stearns died unexpectedly in his hometown on September 24, 1959. </p>
							<p>One of Stearns's sons, Charles Edward, was a professor of geology and dean of Tufts College of Liberal Arts from 1954-1967 and 1968-1969. The Stearns Building, located at 120 Harrison Avenue on the Boston Campus and formerly known as the Eclipse Building, was named in his memory in 1963. </p>

							<head>Stearns Village, 1946-1955</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00358"><head>Stearns Village, n.d.</head></figure>Stearns Village was a temporary housing community constructed by Tufts during the spring of 1946 in an attempt to alleviate the housing shortages that daunted veterans and their families returning to the college on the G.I. Bill of Rights after World War II. </p>
							<p>The village was located on the property known as the Stearns Estate on College Avenue, adjoining <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName>, facing Stanley Street. George L. Stearns was a local pre-Civil war businessman and supporter of the abolitionist movement. The estate served as a stop on the underground railroad assisting slaves to escape from the south to the north. After World War I, Stearns' widow bequeathed the estate to Tufts. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, the land remained undeveloped until the college was faced with the housing crisis.</p>
							<p>Twelve temporary buildings, housing eighty apartments, were obtained through the Federal Public Housing Administration (FPHA). The units had been previously used to house employees of an aircraft plant in Hartford, Connecticut. FPHA financed the relocation of the complex, which was disassembled, trucked to its new location, and reassembled. Construction began in March 1946. By late April, half of the units were in place and the entire complex was ready for its first occupants for summer school session at the end of June. </p>
							<p>At first, preference for occupancy was given to dental, medical and graduate students with a few undergraduate veterans being included. Later, due to a housing shortage in the area, junior faculty members unable to secure living quarters were admitted to the residences. </p>
							<p>Each two-story building housed six to seven families. The units were divided into sixteen studio, eight one-bedroom and fifty-six two-bedroom apartments. Each had its own heating, plumbing and cooking facilities. These appliances included an old-fashioned ice-box and an oil heater in each living room. Refrigerators were left to be purchased by the tenants. An elaborate clothesline schedule was set up, exemplifying the cramped quarters and space limitations of the village. FPHA allocated bedding and bath furnishings for the units. Rent ranged from $22.50 to $30.75 a month for a unit, depending on its size. An additional $3.00-$5.50 was charged if the tenants wanted furnishings included.</p>
							<p>The initial population included more than forty children, and towards the end of its existence, the village was reported to have the highest birth rate in Middlesex County. This led to the establishment of a cooperative babysitting league. The Tufts Wives Club was also formed in 1946 to provide an outlet for the "book worm widows" that lived in the village while their husbands completed their degrees. Under the club's guidance, the league evolved into a licensed day-care center, the Stearns Village Nursery School, which existed from 1949-1951. It was then absorbed by the Boston Nursery Training School, which changed its name in 1955 to the Eliot-Pearson Children's School.</p>
							<p>Technically, the Stearns Village and its activities were under FPHA's jurisdiction, with Tufts being responsible for periodic reports. In 1948, the federal government turned over the entire responsibility for the operation to the college. Due to housing shortages, Tufts asked FPHA for a five year extension of the life of the village, which was also approved by Medford. </p>
							<p>Architect Arland A. Dirlam, A1926, had originally proposed plans to make the pre-fabricated homes more attractive. Unfortunately, they were never enacted. The temporary structures were not aesthetically pleasing additions to the campus, nor were they built to withstand an additional five years use. Paved roadways led to each building and provided parking, but no other major landscaping efforts were made. The deterioration of the structures over the ten-year period included the total collapse of one end of one the units. The village was torn down in 1955.</p>
							<p>The area was transformed into a parking area, known as Stearns Lot, and provided the land for the Eliot-Pearson Children's School. In 1999, the parking lot became the site of the Gantcher Family Sports and Convocation Center. </p>

							<p>Stephen John Sapuppo was born in 1959 in Lawrence, attended schools in Lawrence and Andover, and graduated from Governor Dummer Academy in Georgetown, Massachusetts in 1977.</p>
							<p>Very active in drama at all schools, he was presented the Best Thespian Award from Governor Dummer Academy "for meritorious work in the field of dramatics, for inspiring participation, providing leadership, and developing theatrical knowledge and abilities." </p>
							<p>His acting abilities were continued at Tufts University and as a president of Torn Ticket. After graduating in 1981 with a B.A. cum laude, his acting interests took him to New York and later to Los Angeles in pursuit of his dreams until his untimely death in 1993. He was kind and considerate of friends and family; talented, entertaining, and a wonderful son.</p>
							<p>His parents Mike and Helen, his brothers Nunzi, Michael, and Christopher and sisters Lisamarie and Saramichelle have established this scholarship in Stephen's name to perpetuate his love of drama. They look for qualities and talents similar to Stephen's in Tufts students to help provide them an opportunity to pursue that dream in the entertainment world. </p>

							<head>Students Concerned About Racism, 1968-1969</head>
							<p> Students Concerned About Racism (SCAR), an undergraduate student organization, was formed in 1968 to increase enrollment of students of color at Tufts University. The group of approximately 150 students worked directly with high school students and counselors to bring African-American youth from the South and from urban areas to Tufts. </p>
							<p>SCAR was formed after a brief, non-violent confrontation between administrators and about three hundred students on April 12, 1968. Two days earlier, a group of black students had walked out of a memorial service for recently assassinated Dr. Martin Luther King, claiming the service was hypocritical. On the twelfth, students confronted the administration, demanding that an extra twenty students of color be admitted to both Tufts and Jackson Colleges. Dean of Admissions John Palmer quickly agreed to the demands, on the condition that students aid the administration in recruiting and finding aid for the new students. In order to meet this challenge, SCAR was formed. </p>
							<p>Led by co-chairs Charles Jordan, A1969, and Martha M. Constantine, J1969, SCAR contacted over 270 students, many of whom had not applied to schools for fear that they would be rejected or would not be able to afford the financial commitment. Of the 270 contacted, twenty students went on to enroll in the fall of 1969. To help these twenty cover the cost of Tufts, SCAR campaigned among students and faculty to build funds for financial aid. About half of the Tufts faculty agreed to donate one percent of their salary to aid for SCAR students, and over 600 students agreed to give up Saturday night meals, so that the proceeds could be used for financial aid. The trustees also voted to allot $50,000 to those recruited by the program. </p>
							<p>SCAR's statement of goals included the recruitment of black students, procurement of aid and housing for new students, a reassessment of curricula in areas where the place of black men in history and society has been overlooked, establishment of a tutorial program to provide academic support when necessary, and improvement of methods of recruiting black faculty and personnel to teach and work at Tufts.</p>
							<p>After gaining national attention for its recruiting efforts, SCAR disbanded, just one year after its founding, in the spring of 1969. SCAR leaders claimed that the organization couldn't fulfill its original intent. Although they had been successful in recruiting students to attend Tufts, leaders felt that the organization had not effectively dealt with racism on campus, especially subliminal racism in courses. </p>

							<p> Harold E. Sweet (1877-1962), A1898, served the college as president of the Board of Trustees for twenty-six years beginning in 1923. In 1950, he was a recipient of the Ballou Medal, the highest honor which can be bestowed upon a Tufts graduate.</p>
							<p>Born in West Mansfield, Massachusetts, on June 24, 1877, Sweet attended English and Classical High Schools in Providence, Rhode Island, before entering Tufts College. While an undergraduate, Sweet held the positions of junior class president and charter president of the Tower Cross, the senior honor society. He also acted as the manager of the varsity football team. Soon after graduating with honorable mention in German and philosophy, he went to work as a bench hand at R.F. Simmons and Co, where he eventually became president. </p>
							<p>In his early twenties, Sweet became director of the First National Bank of Attleboro and later assumed the role of president of the institution. He also served as chairman of the board of Sturdy Memorial Hospital. Sweet was elected to be the first mayor of Attleboro, Massachusetts, serving from 1915 to 1919, after the town changed to a city form of government. He had previously been a member of Attleboro's school and town finance committees. In 1955, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Tufts President Nils Y. Wessell at the 99th Commencement of Tufts University. Having married Gertrude O. Hunton in 1900, Sweet had two children. His daughter, Marion Sweet Armstrong, was an instructor in the Tufts Schools of Medicine and Dental Medicine form 1934 to 1938.</p>

It was intended to promote good fellowship and, more immediately, "the political and social interests of the Sophomore class."</p>
							<p>One of Sword and Shield's historic functions was to provide what might be called the student version of freshman orientation. When freshmen arrived on campus in the fall they were greeted with "posters outlining their privileges or lack thereof, and freshmen who disregarded the admonition received a summons to meet with Sword and Shield, which emphasized by methods painful to the freshmen the importance of observing the regulations established for their good and the good of the College." In later years, the society became the keeper of Tufts undergraduate customs and in the 1960s was officially known as the Sword and Shield Traditions Society.</p>
							<p>The duties assigned to Sword and Shield by the student council were to act as welcomers of visitors, to run not more than five informal dances per year, to usher at athletic and dramatic functions, to encforce freshmen traditions, to act as vigilance committee for the college, including policing outdoor sings, and to assume responsibility for college song books in the chapel. The group also ran blood drives for the local Red Cross.</p>
							<p>Election to the society at first was by vote of the faculty, but after the first class was elected, election was by the membership of the society, who selected the following year's members from the Junior class. During the academic year 1923-24, there was criticism as some felt that fraternity politics and popularity had undue weight in the selection process. A revision of the rules in 1929-30 changed the process and from that time forward the society nominated qualified members of the rising class, and the class as a whole voted to elect members of the society.</p>
							<p>The last elections for the society were held in April 1969 for the 1969-70 academic year. </p>

							<p>Tau Beta Pi was established at Tufts in 1927, due mostly to the work of Professor Edgar McNaughton. McNaughton had worked since 1923 to bring Tau Beta Pi to Tufts, organizing a student signed petition and working to bring organization representatives to Tufts.

He also served as the school's first secretary and purchasing agent.</p>
							<p>Born in West Randolph, Vermont, on January 22, 1843, Thayer was the son of Doctor Samuel White, who is credited with reestablishing the Medical Department at University of Vermont. Thayer entered the university in 1860, but his studies were interrupted when he enlistedfor military service in the Civil War. Following the war, Thayer returned to Vermont to pursue courses in the university's medical department. He received his medical degree from there in 1865.</p>
							<p>Following stints as a private practitioner and Northern Pacific Railroad Surgeon, Thayer returned to University of Vermont's Medical School as assistant in Histology and Physiology and instructor, and later, adjunct professor in Anatomy. By the time Thayer and his wife, Alice Bemis, moved to Boston in 1878, he was primarily concerned with the problems of medical education.</p>
							<p>In 1893, when the policies of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston came into question, Thayer, along with six other physicians, removed himself from the corporation. Working with Thayer's idea to create a medical faculty in connection with a university, the physicians approached President Capen of Tufts College, who found the proposal quite favorable, and supported the founding of the Tufts College Medical School in 1893. </p>
							<p>Thayer poured his energies into establishing the school, serving as its secretary, purchasing agent, and professor of Anatomy for the college's first twelve years. From 1905 until 1909, Thayer also held the position of emeritus professor of Anatomy. Thayer died of heart disease in 1910 in Atlantic City, New Jersey.</p>
							<p>Thayer was Editor of the Atlantic Medical weekly, a Fellow of the Massachusetts Medical Society, and maintained several memberships in Vermont's medical organizations. He received an honorary Master of Arts from the University of Vermont in 1899. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00331"><head>Theresa McDermott Carzo, n.d.</head></figure>The Theresa McDermott Carzo Award in honor of Theresa McDermott Carzo, a 1984 graduate of Tufts through the Resumed Education for Adult Learners (REAL) Program, is given to a student in the REAL Program who demonstrates a love of learning and the determination necessary to return to college to complete a degree despite obstacles.</p>
							<p>Theresa McDermott Carzo has been a lifelong supporter of learning and the arts. The youngest of four children, she grew up outside Philadelphia with her Scottish-born parents. When she was six, her father died and her mother worked to support the family. Theresa spent many hours after school in the local library and art museum, developing a love for the arts as she passed the time each day until her mother returned home from work.</p>
							<p>In 1950, she graduated from Notre Dame High School in Moylan, Pennsylvania, soon married (Rocco Carzo, the famed Tufts athletic director), and worked as a secretary, teacher, and volunteer. She raised four sons and one daughter while moving around the country to Delaware, California, and Massachusetts.</p>
							<p>In 1984, she received a B.A. in art history from Tufts. The Theresa McDermott Carzo Award was established in her name by her husband and children, who were inspired by her determination and persistence in earning a degree, and to recognize others who have done the same.</p>

							<p> John Phillip Tilton (1900-59) held the positions of Provost and Senior Vice President at Tufts, beginning in 1951 and 1953, respectively. During his time at Tufts, Tilton helped develop educational and graduate programs at the institution. Tilton was born in Dedham, Massachusetts, on December 18, 1900. He graduated from Colby College in 1923 and startied his professional life as a high school teacher in the state of Maine. He received his Master of Education from Harvard in 1927.In 1933,Harvard also awarded him a Doctor of Education. He taught English at Newton High School until joining the Tufts faculty as an instructor in education in 1927. The following year, he married Ruth Dinsmore. They had one daughter, Kay Grace Tilton. He was named an assistant professor at Tufts in 1933 and associate professor in 1946, attaining full professorship the following year. His administrative positions at the college were extensive. From 1936 to 1955, Tilton served as director of the Department of Education. He also directed graduate studies from 1939 until 1943, when the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was founded. Tilton became the school's first dean, holding the position until 1953. He was also instrumental in the development of the College of Special Studies and the Summer Session. In 1951, he was appointed to the position of Provost, and assumed the role of Senior Vice President two years later. Outside of Tufts, Tilton sat on several committees associated with higher education within the Greater Boston area. He died on January 15, 1959 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston following a brief illness.</p>
							<p>Tilton Hall, a dormitory on the Medford Campus, was named in his honor. </p>

							<head>Tisch Library, 1996</head>
							<p> Tisch Library, formerly Wessell Library, opened in January 1996 after twenty-one million dollars worth of renovation and new construction. </p>
							<p>By the early 1990s, it was clear that Arts and Sciences' library facilities were unable to meet the growing needs of the school. Wessell Library was cold and dark, and was not large enough to accommodate the growing student body. Renovations were clearly necessary to bring Wessell up to the level of libraries at competing universities.</p>
							<p>After receiving a ten million dollar grant from alumni Jonathan and Stephen Tisch, administrators and architects began planning the improved facility. Instead of building up, administrators decided to build out. This saved the library roof, a popular hangout for students. </p>
							<p>The renovations, which took about two years to complete, added 80,000 square feet to the facility. This allowed for enclosed quiet study areas, improved audio-visual facilities and classrooms, and brought the seating capacity up to 1250. The building was also made handicap accessible, and extra windows were added to bring more natural light to library users. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Tisch still serves as the library for Arts and Sciences and remains one of the busiest buildings on the Medford campus. </p>

He was a professor of chemistry at Wesleyan University and director of research at Merck &amp; Company. </p>
							<p>Born in Boston in 1907, his pharmaceutical career began when, as a child, he was an errand boy for the neighborhood pharmacy and was exposed to the suffering and death that occurred in the 1919 influenza epidemic. While a pre-med student at Tufts, he continued working in a pharmacy, earning certification as a pharmacist. This interest changed his focus to chemistry. He went on from Tufts to earn master's and doctoral degrees from Harvard in 1932 and 1934, and was recruited by George W. Merck in 1937. At Merck he worked to isolate and then synthesize vitamins B2, B6, K1, and E and led the team that made penicillin production a reality. He also directed the development of drugs for heart disease, hypertension, depression, and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
							<p>When he retired from Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Research Laboratories in 1970 as vice president for research, he was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and had received numerous honors and awards. He joined Wesleyan University "to teach, to become involved with students, and to continue to reflect and speak and write about sciences, social issues, and national policy." He wrote and published more than 100 papers and was granted well over 100 U.S. patents. As an emeritus professor, he was elected to the U.S. Commerce Department's Inventors' Hall of Fame and received the National Medal of Science. </p>
							<p>He became a trustee of Tufts in 1950 and was elected a life trustee in 1965. He contributed to the Lillian and Joseph Leibner Award for excellence in teaching and advising of students. From his time as life trustee and trustee emeritus he is fondly remembered for his characteristic urge to reflect and speak and write. He said that at Tufts he "was taught both the joy of scholarly pursuits and what it means to be a warm human being and a good citizen." </p>
							<p>Max Tishler died March 18, 1989, at the age of eighty-two. </p>

							<p> Torn Ticket II was formed in 1981 by the merger of Torn Ticket and Top Hat and Tails, two undergraduate musical theater groups. </p>
							<p>The original Torn Ticket was founded in 1971 by six Tufts sophomores to perform full-length musicals. It attracted interested students from the departments of drama, music, dance, and across the undergraduate student body.</p>
							<p>Top Hat and Tails, founded in 1979 by Jack Minsky, A1980, and Debbie Perkins, J1982, was designed to act as an alternative to Torn Ticket. Instead of performing full-length musicals, Top Hat and Tails focused on performing shorter musical revues. The group attempted to foster and support musical theater at Tufts by making it more accessible. The shorter productions took less time to rehearse, therefore allowing students to participate without as great a time commitment. </p>
							<p>In November of 1982, Torn Ticket and Top Hat and Tails merged to form Torn Ticket II. The new organization performed both full-length musicals and shorter musical revues. With the merger, both organizations could combine their budgets and student support in order to strengthen the presence of musical theater at Tufts.</p>
							<p>As of 2001, Torn Ticket II continues to produce musical theater at Tufts. </p>

							<p>Tousey resided there until 1917, when Professor Edward H. Rockwell of the engineering school moved in. He lived there until 1921, when it was purchased by the Commons Club, a local fraternity. Since that time the house has served as a fraternity house, with the exception of the years 1943-47, when it was used as a dormitory for Jackson College.</p>
							<p>The Commons Club became Delta Phi Sigma in 1924 and in 1931 joined the national fraternity Alpha Kappa Pi. When Jackson released the house in 1947 it was taken again for a fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi.</p>

							<head>Tower Cross, 1897-1970</head>
							<p> Tower Cross was an honor society for seniors founded in 1897 by then-student Alaric Bertrand Start. Election to Tower Cross was considered one of the highest honors that could be bestowed on an undergraduate. The group's motto was "For the Highest" and its mission was "to advance the best interests of Tufts College by maintaining a high standard of loyalty among the undergraduate students." Induction took place in a ceremony in Goddard Chapel complete with caps and gowns.</p>
							<p>Tower Cross played an important role in campus activities. Its members organized lecture series, all-campus dinners, and other activities. Until 1903, when the Interfraternity Council was organized, Tower Cross oversaw the annual rush period for all fraternities on campus. Officially, Tower Cross was charged with the following activities: it ran Tufts Night and rallies before games, assumed the duties of the Under Class Rules Committee, supervised competition for organized cheerleading, policed regular chapel meetings, ran the annual sports dances, assumed the duties of the Athletic Association Nominating Committee, conducted organized financial drives, conducted elections of cheerleaders, conducted Junior and Sophomore elections, including counting of votes, elected from its own membership three men to represent Tufts on the Class Day Committee. The society also sponsored two annual singing competitions, the Christmas Sing and the Spring Sing. In these competitions student groups, either fraternities, sororities, or dormitory groups, prepared songs and were awarded prizes for their performances.</p>
							<p>Election to the society at first was by vote of the faculty, but after the first class was elected, election was by the membership of the society, who selected the following year's members from the Junior class. During the academic year 1923-24, there was criticism as some felt that fraternity politics and popularity had undue weight in the selection process. A revision of the rules in 1929-30 changed the process and from that time forward the society nominated qualified members of the rising class, and the class as a whole voted to elect members of the society.</p>
							<p>The last elections for the society were held in April 1969 for the 1969-70 academic year. </p>

							<head>Tuftonian, 1864-1965</head>
							<p> The first undergraduate publication at Tufts, known unofficially as the "annual," was the Tuftonian. Over the years, the Tuftonian went through many incarnations, serving as a literary magazine, newspaper, alumni journal, and a number of other purposes, and its history is closely intertwined with that of other Tufts undergraduate publications. The Tuftonian appeared in various formats, with several gaps, for a span of one hundred years.</p>
							<p>Two fraternities, Zeta Psi and Theta Delta Chi, sponsored the original Tuftonian. It appeared once a year between 1864 and 1872, and contained descriptions of student organizations, sketches of faculty, and articles directed toward the undergraduate population. The first volume (1864-1870), was composed of seven issues in tabloid size. Thereafter it was published in pamphlet form. The aspirations of the early editors to turn the publication into a "literary magazine" were abysmal failures, judging from the recorded comments of those responsible for it. The fraternities experienced differences of opinion over the contents of the publication in 1872, leading to two separate publications being published for three years. Zeta Psi continued the Tuftonian, while Theta Delta Chi produced the Budget, which could be considered Tuft's first true literary publication. </p>
							<p>The Tufts College Publishing Association was founded in 1874 to broaden the base of student publications at the college, and produced the Tufts Collegian which appeared monthly for four years and served as an undergraduate newspaper and a solicitation vehicle for alumni contributions. In 1878, the two fraternities reconciled and agreed to share the journalistic field with others, allowing the Publishing Association to abandon the name Collegian and appropriate the name Tuftonian. Subscription rates were $1.00 for the academic year, with publishing cost being subsidized by the sale of advertising space. </p>
							<p>Until the appearance of the Weekly, a student newspaper, in 1895, the Tuftonian served the campus as a multi-purpose journal, including news, literary pieces, and alumni information. It shifted to a literary journal form following the establishment of the Weekly, and after World War I, became a quarterly publication. For many years, both the Tuftonian and the Weekly were operated under the auspices of the Publishing Association. Faculty members selected the editor-in-chief of each publication as a method of preventing rivalries among the fraternities and other student societies over the position. Due to financial difficulties, the publication was required to call on the support of the faculty and the trustees over the years. The production costs of student publications were eventually included in the student activities fees, which was charged to individuals attending tufts college. Subscriptions, however, were still solicited from those who had left the hill. </p>
							<p>After the appearance of thirty-six volumes, the Tuftonian suspended its publication in 1911.It reappeared fifteen years later in the spring of 1926 as a new series with a different format. Its modified return was prompted by the demise of the alumni magazine, the Tufts College Graduate in February 1926. From 1926 to 1940, the Tuftonian published fourteen volumes as a literary magazine at Tufts College. It changed again in the fall of 1940, changing its format to include more alumni information and renumbering its volumes once again. The reconditioned publication was at first co-edited by a Jackson undergraduate and John Holmes, Tufts poet and faculty member. The focus of the new version of the Tuftonian, was to serve as the magazine of Tufts College, including not only students, but also faculty, staff, and alumni. This move was for the "greater good" of the college and was supported by the college's president, Leonard Carmichael. In 1965, the Tuftonian's contents were divided among several campus publications, primarily the Literary Magazine of Tufts University. </p>

							<p> The Tufts Abyssal Plain is a 14,000 square mile plain located two and a half miles under the Pacific Ocean off the northwestern coast of the United States. It was named by marine geologist Robert Hurley, A1951.</p>
							<p>The plain covers an area twice the size of New England, spanning 350 miles north to south and 400 miles east to west. It is located south of the Aleutian Islands and due west of Seattle. </p>
							<p>Hurley, a professor at the Institute of Marine Science at the University of Miami, named the plain in the late 1950s while making oceanographic studies in the area. Hurley felt the name was appropriate as it not only honored the university, but also honored the work of Tufts alumni in the area. Admiral Leo O. Colbert, E1907, a former director of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey that charted nearby Alaskan coastal waters, had hired more survey engineers from Tufts than from any other college. The name therefore honors the Tufts men who were among the first to chart waters in the area. </p>

							<p>After purchasing the building from the City of Somerville, Tufts began a series of renovations that totaled about seven million dollars. Somerville kept a presence in the completed building, however, setting up human services and services for the elderly offices among others. </p>
							<p>Generally a quiet building because of its separation from campus, TAB, as it came to be known, did experience one of the larger campus protests of the late eighties. On September 26, 1988, during the grand opening ceremonies for the building, about forty Tufts students marched through the front door, protesting the recent switching of some Buildings and Grounds workers to a night shift. Calling the switch unfair to the workers, the student protestors disrupted the festivities and confronted President Jean Mayer. The protest remained peaceful, and after talking with Mayer and other Tufts officials, the students left the building.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, the Tufts Administration Building continues to serve as home to many important Tufts facilities, including the server from which all Tufts campus computers gain internet access. </p>

His donation of twenty acres was valued at $20,000 and was located on one of the highest hills in the Boston area, called Walnut Hill. The land was given to the Universalist church on the condition that it be used for a college. With subsequent gifts, his donations of land to the college totaled more than 100 acres.</p>
							<p>Tufts was engaged in farming and brick manufacturing, and he owned substantial amounts of land in Medford and Somerville. A descendant of Peter Tufts, an early colonist who settled in Malden in 1638, Tufts married Hannah Robinson in 1821, but had no children.</p>

							<head>Tufts Community Union, 1924</head>
							<p> The Tufts Community Union comprises all undergraduate students in the colleges of liberal arts, Jackson, and engineering, who pay the annual student activities fee. Student Government serves as the representative body of the TCU, dealing with all aspects of student life. Students can be elected to positions within the TCU's government structure, or they may apply for appointments to student, student-faculty or trustee committees.</p>
							<p>Discussion of establishing a student government system at Tufts College began in campus media as early as 1885, while the first proposal for such an organization, put forth in 1917 by members of the junior class was rejected.</p>
							<p>The first constitution of the Tufts student body was ratified in 1924, establishing agoverning body called the Student Council of Tufts College. Formed to support the "unification of the various lines of extracurricular life at Tufts College, and the placing of some authority in the hands of a representative body of Tufts undergraduates. The original structure included ten representatives from student organizations and one faculty member.</p>
							<p>In 1943, the constitution was altered for the first time, to unify the civilian students and military on campus as a result of World War II.It was again changed in 1962, creating more opportunities for student representation. The presidents of all four classes and sixteen representatives formed the council, with the president elected by popular vote of the student population.</p>
							<p>The term Tufts Community Union (TCU) was first used in 1968. Including all students on the hill, the TCU was governed by a five-person board and four subsidiary committees, including a student Committee on Student Life and a faculty Committee on Student Life. Drastic changes were made to the constitution in 1970, with members of the TCU being defined as all students paying the Student Activites fee. The 1970 document outlined a Student Tri-Partite Committee with five members, the Committee on Student Life, the Educational Policies Committee, and the Committee on Extra-University Affairs, with a student caucus regulating the allocation of the student activities fee.</p>
							<p>In 1972, additional changes to the constitution were made, with thirty-five senators being elected from the student body and in-house elections used to appoint its officers. The major function of the TCU Senate at that time was to allocate the Student Activities Fee among student organizations.</p>
							<p>In January 1981, the Committee on Student Life called a constitutional convention to re-draft the constitution. The proposed document included a Judiciary to rule on matters on constitutionality and an impartial election board to run future elections. It also lowered the number of voting senators from thirty-five to twenty-nine. The constitution was again amended in 1996.</p>
							<p>The student government system includes the Senate, the Judiciary, the Elections Board, class councils, and the student members of the Committee on Student Life. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Tufts Dance Collective, 1978-" id="T00024">
							<head>Tufts Dance Collective, 1978-</head>
							<p>The Tufts Dance Collective (TDC) was initially conceived as a partnership between students and faculty. The organization replaced the discarded Dance Advisory Board, whose officers became the Steering Committee for the new collective.</p>
							<p>Partnered with the Physical Education Department, TDC planned, organized and executed shows for the end of each semester. Originally the shows were faculty-choreographed and consisted solely of students from classes in the dance department. Another function of the collective included the importation of visiting performers and dance companies, for shows and for special master classes.</p>
							<p>The 1978 Winter Dance was TDC's first show. It was held in what used to be the Cousens Dance Studio, located above the baseball cage. For that spring semester, TDC hoped to host a student-choreographed show.</p>
							<p>By 1986 the description of the Collective had changed. It had become an "informal organization in which dancers of all backgrounds combine efforts to create a show consisting of a full flavor of different dance styles."Some years, dances were organized around a theme, usually with serious intent. In 1986 TDC was joined by Sarabande (another student organization), and the Department of Drama and Dance, in sponsoring their end-of-the-semester dances, held in Cohen Auditorium.</p>
							<p>Practice space for the Collective remained in Cousens until 1993.At the end of that year Cousens Dance Studio was converted, and the dancers moved to tiny Jackson Gym. Co-Artistic Directors of TDC Krista Kupperschmidt and Christy Uchida complained to The Daily about the loss of their practice space.</p>
							<p>Over the years, as the Department of Drama and Dance's web page describes, TDC became "a student-run, extracurricular, modern dance group open to students of all levels and experience."Gone was the association with the PE department, as well as faculty advisors and advanced dance classes. The old organization, with a steering committee, gave way in the 1980s to a system with two artistic directors. Students choreographed every dance, and dancers were anyone who wished to perform. Moreover, the end-of-the-semester dance show had moved from the spacious hall of Cohen Auditorium to the tiny studio in Jackson Gym, which necessitated small audiences and numerous performances. This change came in part from the organizations' decision not to charge for tickets to their shows.</p>
							<p>In the late 1990s Tufts students had more dance and performance art organizations to choose from, including TDC, Sarabande, and Spirit of Color. Practice time was tougher than ever to come by, even though a studio in Hill Hall and a separate room in Jackson now supplemented the space in Jackson gym. Moreover, dance organizations were becoming very popular with students, particularly TDC.During the 2000-2001 year, more than 200 students participated in the Tufts Dance Collective. Audiences who came to the dance shows spilled out of the theater at every show, forcing a response from the Dance Department.</p>
							<p>In 2001 the Drama Department informed the group that they would no longer be able to perform in Jackson gym. The same year, as TDC struggled to handle the large number of interested participants, the constitution of the group was amended to include five officers, rather than the old system empowering two artistic directors.</p>
							<p>These officers, with Kelly Dutton and Jen Fisher at the head, spearheaded an effort to move TDC's winter and spring shows back into Cohen Auditorium, and the shows were an instant success, each quickly selling out. Hundreds of students came out each semester to join TDC, and limits were placed on the numbers of dancers allowed on stage.</p>
							<p>Today, in 2003, TDC remains a prominent and popular group on campus, practicing wherever and whenever they can find space.</p>

							<p> Tufts Emergency Medical Services (TEMS) is a volunteer, student-run, quick-response basic life support service on the Medford campus. Founded in 1985 by David Levitt, A1985, a Tufts senior, TEMS works with the Office of Public Safety to provide round the clock emergency medical coverage to the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>TEMS grew out of the work of David Levitt, who worked with friends beginning in fall 1984 to establish the service on the Medford campus. The group received recognition and funding from the Tufts Community Union Senate in 1985, but struggled for a number of years to acquire adequate equipment on a limited budget. At first, volunteers responded to calls on foot with only basic first aid supplies and only during limited hours. In 1987 TEMS acquired its first vehicle making response times dramatically lower, and in 1991 it was outfitted with a fully-equipped basic life support vehicle, along with two-way radios and sirens. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, TEMS marshalls the resources of approximately thirty student volunteers to provide emergency response services to the Medford campus twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. </p>

							<p> Founded in 1979, Tufts in Barcelona was designed to give students the opportunity to study in Spain and experience the cultural and social dynamics of life on the Iberian peninsula.</p>
							<p>Tufts in Barcelona's first class of fourteen students arrived at the University of Barcelona in the spring of 1980. The university, founded in 1430, is one of the most famous universities in Europe, and attracts some of the leading authorities on the Spanish world. Students took classes both at the downtown campus of the university, and at a campus located in the western suburbs of Barcelona.</p>
							<p>Under the direction of Angel and Joan Berenguer, visiting Tufts students were not only given a chance to explore Barcelona, the second oldest city in Spain, but were also taken on university sponsored tours to surrounding regions in Spain. Each year, students participated in group day trips and one weekend trip to historical monuments and points of interest in northeastern Spain. Visiting students were also invited to monthly lectures and receptions, held at the program center, featuring important figures in Spanish cultural and political life. </p>
							<p>The program was forced to move to Madrid in 1985 because of the growing language barrier between the university faculty and students in the program. By 1984, the faculty at the University of Barcelona was conducting many classes in Catalan. For American students schooled in castillian or Latin American Spanish, this created obvious difficulties. The program was discontinued after 1984 and moved to Madrid, where Tufts began a partnership with the Autonomous University of Madrid. </p>

							<p> Tufts in Italy was established in 1961 to give students interested in classics the opportunity to study overseas. Undergraduate students at any university in America were encouraged to apply for the Tufts-sponsored program. </p>
							<p>Developed by the Department of classics in conjunction with the Vergilian Society of the United States, Tufts in Italy was essentially designed for students with a strong interest in classics. The program was limited to twenty students, and was open to all American undergraduates, not just students at Tufts. Upon arrival in Naples, enrolled students took classes taught entirely by visiting Tufts faculty members. During the first year of the program, five courses were offered, three of them required. The course number would expand to ten, and then to twenty-six courses during the program's life span. The only requirement of incoming students was one year of college-level Latin.</p>
							<p>In Naples, students were housed first at the Villa Vergilian, about fifteen minutes out of the city, and later at a pair of boarding houses in Naples itself. Meals were served at the boarding houses, but students were given an allowance to eat out once a week. Students participating in the program were also able to experience the rest of Italy. Students in archeology classes participated in weekly archeological digs outside of Naples, and students in Italian Civilization classes took university-sponsored tours of Naples. The entire group of students also took three week-long trips to other cities in Italy. The group spent a week each in Rome, Sicily, and Florence at different points during the year. A summer session was added to the program in 1966 to offer more students a chance to see Italy. </p>
							<p>Tufts in Italy was suspended in 1968, a victim of rising costs. The university could no longer afford to support the program, as costs had risen dramatically since its inception. </p>

							<head>Tufts in London, 1967</head>
							<p> The Tufts in London program began the fall of 1967, and was originally designed to serve as a program for junior year students of drama, English, and related arts. At its founding, Tufts in London was the only international academic year program in drama operated by an American university. </p>
							<p>Tufts in London, originally run by James Forsyth, a famed British dramatist, poet, painter, and sculptor, was not affiliated with any universities in London. Instead, students took seminar classes taught by distinguished British academics and artists. Although students praised the faculty and the courses, there were complaints about isolation from British students and the British educational experience. Students also felt that their living quarters were overcrowded. Instead of being housed in a university-style dorm, students originally lived in the Reynolds Hotel, described as "quaint, personal, and very British," but unfortunately also very crowded when class size grew from the original thirty three to forty two students. </p>
							<p>By the early eighties, it was clear that the Tufts in London program needed to be restructured. By 1981, it was the only Tufts abroad program not affiliated with another university, and complaints about isolation continued. To remedy the problem, Tufts instituted a one-year trial affiliation with Westfield College in the fall of 1982. Unfortunately, Westfield, a branch of the University of London, began experiencing major financial troubles by 1983. A 1984 Tufts study subsequently concluded that the program should be moved to a different location in London. Finally, in the fall of 1988, Westfield College closed, and Tufts in London moved to the University College of London, the oldest, largest, and most distinguished college of the University of London. </p>
							<p>Currently Tufts in London enrolls up to fifty students for a yearlong program. Students are completely integrated into the University College of London, and are housed in co-ed UCL dorms. The program is administered by a full-time resident director and occupies offices on the UCL campus in central London. </p>

							<head>Tufts in Madrid, 1985</head>
							<p> Tufts in Madrid was founded in 1985 to replace the university's program in Barcelona, which had to be moved because of growing language barrier problems.</p>
							<p>The Tufts in Madrid program works in conjunction with the Autonomous University of Madrid, located nine miles outside Madrid city limits. The university was founded in 1968, and is well known for its international relations program. Students involved in the program spend half of their time on the university campus, and the remainder at the program headquarters in downtown Madrid. </p>
							<p>Twenty students per year are accepted into the Tufts in Madrid program after demonstrating interest and a strong control of the Spanish language. The program is a yearlong endeavor, but students may apply to attend for one semester only. When in Spain, students are housed with local families to facilitate one on one contact with Spanish culture and language. </p>
							<p>Tufts in Madrid also offers opportunities for visiting students to become acquainted with Spanish cultural and political figures, sponsoring a lecture series which students are required to attend. As part of a Spanish Theater course, students are reimbursed for attending local cultural events, such as plays, concerts, and museum exhibits.</p>
							<p>The program, administered in partnership with Skidmore in Madrid, has remained one of Tufts' most popular study abroad programs. The central location of Madrid and its proximity to important historical spots in Spain has made it easy for students to travel locally and experience life in Spain, while learning about the history of the nation.</p>

							<p> Tufts in Moscow, an exchange program with the Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology, began in the fall of 1991. It is one of the first American exchange programs in Russia to focus on teaching subjects outside of the Russian language.</p>
							<p>Tufts in Moscow allows three students per semester to travel to Russia and study at Mendeleyev University. Founded in 1920, the university is one of the leading chemical and technical institutes in the world, and also offers strong liberal arts courses. Prospective students must have three years of college Russian, and much demonstrate proficiency before their departure. Once students arrive in Moscow, they are housed with Russian families in the area. Originally, students lived in a special dorm for visiting students. Generally viewed as a negative aspect of the program, such housing was required due to security concerns at general university housing. As post-Soviet Russia settled down politically, students were finally allowed to live with Russian families, thus giving them greater exposure to the Russian language and Russian life. </p>
							<p>Special features of the program include a three-day excursion to St. Petersburg, a daylong trip to a historic Russian city and day tours of Moscow. Also, Tufts in Moscow offers American students the chance to take both science and liberal arts classes at Mendeleyev. Most US exchange programs to Russia focus mainly on language, and tend to ignore other subjects.</p>
							<p>Tufts in Moscow was developed after Professor Martin Sherwin of the Tufts Department of History organized a satellite link-up with Mendeleyev called the Space Bridge, a joint discussion between Russian students and Tufts students about the environment. Using modern technology,After the event, Tufts administrators proposed an exchange program, having failed in previous negotiations with the University of Moscow. </p>
							<p>As part of the program, three Russian students are brought to study at Tufts each semester. </p>

							<head>Tufts in Paris, 1965</head>
							<p> Tufts in Paris, founded in the fall of 1965, gives Tufts students an opportunity to experience French life and culture while continuing their studies. </p>
							<p>Unlike other early Tufts Study Abroad programs, Tufts in Paris was designed primarily for undergraduates. The program encourages French majors to apply, but also accepts non-majors who demonstrate proficiency in French. Students participating in Tufts in Paris attend classes at the University of Paris, focusing mainly on French language, culture, history, and politics. Students are housed with French families, and are required to eat breakfast and dinner at their host's home six times a week. Allowances are given for lunch, and students can otherwise arrange their free time as they choose. </p>
							<p>Prior to beginning studies at the university, students participate in a month long orientation program, which includes lectures as well as visits to historical sites, museums, and other European cities. </p>
							<p>The first year of the Tufts in Paris program proved very interesting for participating students. As one of their classes focused on French politics, they were able to discuss the circumstances surrounding the first French elections since World War II, which took place while they were on the program. In 1968, Tufts students in France were also present for the onslaught of student and worker strikes, during which much of Paris was shut down due to rioting and picketing. This caused minor complaints among students, as it disrupted class schedules and took many of their French peers out of the classroom. </p>
							<p>Early in the life of the program, students also complained about their living situations. Many claimed that living with French families was not a good experience, as many of the families viewed visiting students as only a source of income and a curiosity for their friends. This improved by the late seventies and early eighties, and the program once again began to garner rave reviews. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Tufts in Paris enrolls thirty students each year, and continues to be a popular option for Tufts students desiring study abroad. </p>

							<head>Tufts in Tubingen, 1965</head>
							<p> The Tufts in Tubingen program, founded in the fall of 1965, was originally designed to serve as a graduate program for students planning to teach German in American colleges and universities. An undergraduate program was added in the fall of 1967, allowing juniors with third year level proficiency in German to participate. </p>
							<p>The Tubingen program, which accepts up to twenty students a year, is integrated with Eberhard-Karls Universitat in Tubingen. Founded in 1477, Eberhard-Karls is one of the oldest and most respected universities in Germany. The year long program not only allows students to experience German university life, but also provides numerous opportunities for travel around Germany over the course of the year, including planned excursions to Berlin, and even the option of a semester at Jena in the former East Germany. </p>
							<p>Students, selected by the German department, were originally housed with German families, but now are housed in single rooms at the university. They are required to take an intensive three-week course in German before their departure, and then remain in Germany through the second, or summer, semester.</p>
							<p>At its inception, Tufts administrators felt that the German university experience would be too difficult for American college students, and hence only the graduate program was founded. Qualified graduate students took a full year of courses in Tubingen, and then returned to Medford to complete comprehensive exams and finish writing theses. After a year, however, administrators decided it was important to allow undergraduates the experience as well. </p>
							<p>Tufts in Tubingen has survived not only a week long student strike in the fall of 1976, but also the fall of the Berlin Wall, which caused a huge influx of East German students. As of 2000, Tufts in Tubingen remains a popular program, accepting students from all majors who can prove proficiency in German. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Tufts Mountain Club, 1939-3000" id="T00036">
							<head>Tufts Mountain Club, 1939-3000</head>
							<p> The Tufts Mountain Club was founded in December of 1939 to allow students to experience outdoor sports and activities year-round.</p>
							<p>In December of 1939, with the backing of the Tufts Ski Club, an effort was made to purchase a shelter for student use in northern New Hampshire. At the same time, student Bill Ballard, a former president of the Tufts Ski Club, called a meeting to judge interest in a group that organized and participated in outdoor activities for every season. </p>
							<p>Finding strong campus interest, Ballard formed a group and named it the Tufts Mountain Club (TMC). After approval from the university, Ballard began advertising around campus. Membership costs were set at three dollars a year, with the stipulation that members could use the lodge at all times. </p>
							<p>The first membership role included President and Mrs. Carmichael, Dean Bush, Professor Houston, and a large group of undergraduates. In order to accommodate interested Jackson students, a female chaperone was hired to stay at the lodge on the first and third weekend of every month. </p>
							<p>During the winter of 1940, TMC laid plans for spring expeditions to the new lodge, and in March, the group merged with the Tufts Ski Club. This not only increased TMC membership, but also facilitated wintertime use of the lodge. </p>
							<p>In 1944, a lack of interest due to the war forced TMC, previously one of the most popular student groups, to disband. Only one year later, however, four students revived the club, and in May 1945 the reformed TMC organized a trip to clean the lodge and prepare it for active use. </p>
							<p>TMC continued to sponsor activities from their New Hampshire lodge until New Years Day, 1962, when the lodge burned to the ground. No one was injured, but the lodge was destroyed. Soon after, plans for a new lodge were drawn up, and Tufts agreed to help pay for its construction. </p>
							<p>TMC has continued to offer numerous activities through the past four decades. Since 1978, the club has had a permit allowing members to climb campus buildings during the daytime, and every Halloween, members place pumpkins on the top of Goddard chapel and at various other locations around campus. In 1983, TMC sponsored its first annual Elbow Pond Cross-Country Ski Race, and in 1986, TMC members secured their place in Tufts history by unearthing the famed gravity stone. </p>
							<p>As of 2001, TMC continues to be one of the most popular student organizations, and still offers and arranges various climbs, hikes, skiing expeditions and canoe trips. </p>

							<head>Tufts Mountain Club Loj, 1940-2000</head>
							<p> One of the major factors in the foundation of the Tufts Mountain Club was the move by members of the Tufts community to purchase a shelter in northern New Hampshire for student and faculty use. The shelter quickly became known as the Tufts Mountain Club Lodge, and, though now in its fourth incarnation, continues to provide the Tufts community with a haven for outdoor activity year-round. </p>
							<p>In 1940, at a cost of fifteen thousand dollars Tufts College purchased a hundred year old, nine-room farmhouse on Eastern Corner Road in Plymouth, New Hampshire. This building became the original Tufts Mountain Club lodge, and was used year round by members of the group as a home base for hiking, skiing, canoeing, and other outdoor activities. During the 1940's and 1950's, Tufts sent a female chaperone to the lodge on the first and third weekend of every month so that Jackson students could also enjoy the benefits of the New Hampshire home. </p>
							<p>On New Years Day, 1962, after two decades of active use, the lodge caught fire and burned to the ground. Although no one was hurt, the building was completely destroyed. Almost immediately, plans were made for the construction of a second lodge. Using insurance money from the original lodge and a grant from the university, a new lodge was constructed in 1963. The new lodge, an A-frame building located in Woodstock, New Hampshire, ushered in a Tufts Mountain Club tradition. Since January, 1963, the group has held an annual "Thanksgiving in January" celebration to remember the original lodge and give thanks that no one was hurt in the fire. </p>
							<p>Soon after its completion, the new lodge had to be demolished. To make way for the continuation of Interstate 93, the government bought out Tufts' property rights and, in the late sixties, demolished the lodge. Using the money the government paid to repossess the land, TMC was able to purchase another lodge. The new building, also located in Woodstock, was a two-story farmhouse with a much larger kitchen and a large common room. The lodge had formerly been used as a petting zoo, and memorabilia from the zoo remains on display. In 1994, however, the building was condemned, and in the winter of 1998, it was torn down. Again, TMC was able to raise enough money to purchase another lodge. The present lodge was built in 1999 to TMC specifications and continues to serve as the base for most of their activities. </p>
							<p>Between 1985 and 1987, TMC members began referring to their building as the Loj. The name stuck, and since then members have referred to the New Hampshire home as the TMC Loj. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA014:UA014.001.DO.03132"><head>Tufts-New England Medical Center building, November 1975</head></figure>The New England Medical Center (NEMC) is the principal teaching hospital for the Medical School and Dental School. The Medical Center's chiefs of service are joint appointees with the medical school and most serve as chairs of their respective departments at the medical school. Students take 25% of their required third year clerkships and 50% of their fourth year electives at NEMC.</p>
							<p>New England Medical Center was established in 1930 through the alliance of the Boston Dispensary, the Boston Floating Hospital for Children, and the Trustees of Tufts College. The NEMC was established as a non-profit corporation to coordinate the administrative activities of its constituent organizations. In 1946 the Pratt Diagnostic Clinic, an extension of the Boston Dispensary established in 1938, joined NEMC.In 1950, when the Medical School and Dental School relocated to Harrison Avenue, the NEMC became known as the New England Medical Center Hospital. </p>
							<p>The entity was renamed Tufts-New England Medical Center in 1968, and in 1970 the NEMC board met at the Coonamessett Inn in Falmouth, Massachusetts to outline ways the NEMC and Tufts could further coordinate operations. The resulting directives, known as the Coonamessett Statement, indicated that support services and other business functions should be made the responsibility of T-NEMC in each case where it made sense to do so. That same year Tufts President Hallowell and NEMC President Quarles signed an affiliation agreement that codified the T-NEMC as an alliance through which its constituent units would move toward a completely integrated operation. By 1976, T-NEMC controlled health care studies, medical engineering, community health and ambulatory care, employee-student health services, lab animal medicine, some research, off-site medical services, a common utility supply center, architectural services, communications, educational media, parking facilities, property ownership, and public relations. However, by the late 1970s both institutions had experienced a change in leadership, resulting in a change of priorities for each. Interest in integration waned and the cooperation forged in the early 1970s was dismantled.</p>
							<p>After a period of tension and competition in the 1980s, Tufts and NEMC drafted a new affiliation agreement in 1991, which remains in effect as of 1999. </p>

							<p> Tufts Night at the Pops takes place every year on the Thursday night before commencement. The program generally includes a performance of Tufts songs, and recently has included performances by Tufts groups such as the Beelzebubs during intermission. </p>
							<p>The first Tufts Night at the Pops was held on May 29, 1901 at newly opened Symphony Hall in Boston. Professor Leo R. Lewis, at the time head of the music department, initiated and coordinated the event. He also conducted a number of Tufts songs during the program, including "Dear Alma Mater," which Lewis wrote. On Tufts Night, the university buys out the 2304 seats in Symphony Hall, and makes the tickets available for alumni, faculty, trustees, and students. From the beginning, it has always been a sold out event. In the early years of Tufts Night, the gatherings got relatively raucous. Tufts students sang along with university songs, danced, waved Tufts banners, and drank wine, beer, and champagne. Occasionally, the planned program was interrupted by an unplanned version of the Tufts College Cheer. The alcohol-fueled rowdiness caused the program to be cancelled in 1914, but it was reinstated the next year after many students protested the cancellations. On the thirtieth anniversary of Tufts Night in 1931, Arthur Fiedler, then conductor of the Pops, presented Professor Lewis, who conducted a few numbers every year, with a Paul Revere silver bowl "for having led the Pops orchestra for a longer number of years than any other conductor." Tufts, in fact, was the first college to have a special night at Symphony Hall.</p>
							<p>Since its inception, Tufts Night at the Pops has been one of the most popular events of Senior Week. The program still occasionally features Tufts performers, and has even been televised on WGBH as part of the "Evening at Pops" series. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Tufts University, 1852" id="T00041">
							<head>Tufts University, 1852</head>
							<p> Tufts College was founded in 1852 by a group of Universalists who had for years worked to open a non-sectarian institution of higher learning. </p>
							<p>By 1830, Universalist efforts to build an institution of higher learning were increasing in both frequency and strength. Many Universalist ministers and laymen alike felt that their community needed a school that intertwined theological and liberal arts courses. Their opponents, however, feared the creation of a theological institution, as they felt it would create clerical domination, and prevent uneducated but devoted Universalists from becoming clergymen.</p>
							<p>In 1835, at the annual General Convention, Thomas Jefferson Sawyer, a prominent Universalist, put forth a recommendation calling for the question of establishing a Theological Seminary to be put to the denomination at large. The resolution was adopted, and for the next four years, Sawyer's colleague, Reverend Thomas Whittemore, worked tirelessly to drum up support, both through columns in the Universalist paper, "The Trumpet," and through speeches. </p>
							<p>By this time it had become clear that a Universalist theological college was a necessary step for the advancement of the religion. Hosea Ballou 2nd, a prolific writer and well-known minister, served as a teacher for many young Universalists interested in joining the clergy. The demand for his teaching had become so great that he had begun to teach classes instead of individual students. This high demand illustrated the need for an official school, planned for either upstate New York or the Boston, Massachusetts, area. </p>
							<p>At the Massachusetts State Convention in 1840, attendees authorized the creation of a board of trustees to raise funds, find a site, and erect the buildings for a Universalist college. The committee included both Hosea Ballou and his son, Hosea Ballou 2nd. After the creation of the board, serious fundraising began, with a goal of $50,000 set for the campaign. Due to a lack of popular support and internal tension on the board, the first effort eventually failed. </p>
							<p>In 1847, another fundraising drive began, this time with a goal of $100,000. Otis Skinner, another prominent Universalist, was selected to head the fundraising team. By 1851, Skinner and his team had reached the goal. By this time, the trustees had also selected the site of the future college. Earlier in the decade, Charles Tufts had donated $20,000 worth of Medford land to the trustees with the stipulation that the college be built on the site. This caused a rift among the trustees. Some felt that the college belonged in New York, others voted for Springfield, and even Hosea Ballou 2nd felt that the Tufts location was too close to Harvard and Boston. The question was put to a vote, and eventually the Medford site prevailed.</p>
							<p>On April 22, 1852, Massachusetts granted a charter to the Trustees of Tufts College for the establishment of an institution of higher learning. The now official Trustees attempted to elect Thomas Jefferson Sawyer as the first president of Tufts, but his salary demands were too high. By 1853, Hosea Ballou 2nd had been selected as the institution's first president. By the fall of 1854, Tufts College, though not yet formally opened, had begun operation. On August 22, 1855, the college held a formal opening, and the first formal term saw over thirty students enrolled. </p>
							<p>Tufts College continued as a liberal arts institution until the fall of 1869, when the Divinity School officially opened. In his will, benefactor Sylvanius Packard had earmarked $300,000 for Tufts, but stipulated that part of the trust must go to the establishment of a Professorship of Christian Theology. Hoping to remain a non-sectarian school, Tufts instead opted to found a separate and quasi-independent Divinity School. In 1906, the Divinity School was renamed the Crane Theological School, and continued operation until 1968.</p>
							<p>The next major event in early Tufts history was the decision to become a co-educational institution. After ten years of debate, the Trustees finally decided to bring women to Tufts College in 1892. Although men and women originally took classes together, Tufts provided separate housing and dining facilities. By the first decade of the twentieth century, however, many administrators were becoming more and more opposed to co-education. Tufts had seen a drop in male enrollment, and many worried that it was because of the presence of women in classes. Women had also begun to dominate academically. In 1906, for example, all five seniors elected to Phi Beta Kappa were female. The co-education question was solved in 1910 using funds from an 1895 grant. Cornelia Marie Jackson had left half of her estate to Tufts to improve facilities for women, including a stipulation that a building be constructed and named The Cornelia M. Jackson College for Women. In 1910, the Trustees decided to use Jackson's funds to create a coordinate college. Jackson was to be separate from Tufts, with female only classes, dormitories, and dining halls. The Trustees felt it was the best way to improve male enrollment without alienating women. Male and female students remained segregated until 1913, when classes were again made co-educational. </p>
							<p>Soon after Tufts became co-educational, an opportunity for a new branch of the college appeared in Boston. In 1893, seven faculty members from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, dissatisfied with their employer, left the school and with the backing of Tufts College formed the Tufts School of Medicine. The downtown Boston school soon spawned another branch. In 1899, Tufts acquired the Boston Dental College, and the renamed Tufts School of Dental Medicine began operation in close coordination with the Tufts School of Medicine. </p>
							<p>Tufts continued its expansion into the twentieth century. In 1933, with a bequest from trustee Austin B. Fletcher, Tufts opened the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The school, opened with the collaboration of Harvard University, became the first graduate school of international affairs in the United States. It also brought tremendous prestige to Tufts, which was quickly gaining a reputation as an excellent school.</p>
							<p>Expansion continued into the 1940's, when Tufts allied with the Bouve-Boston School of Physical Therapy and Physical Education in 1942. In 1945, Tufts formed alliances with both the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston School of Occupational Therapy. In 1951, Tufts began operating the Boston Nursery Training School as a separate entity under the College of Special Studies. In 1955, the school was renamed the Eliot Pearson Children's School.</p>
							<p>1955 brought another important change for Tufts. A petition from the Trustees dated January 20, 1955, and approved on January 28, officially changed the name of the school to Tufts University. The name change, one of President Nils Y. Wessell's original goals, was cited as both an official recognition of an already established event, and also as a recognition of a desirable direction for Tufts to move in.</p>
							<p>Since 1955, Tufts University has continued to expand its horizons. In 1964, in one of Wessell's final acts as president, Tufts opened the Experimental College. The Ex-College, which allows students to take classes not normally found in the curriculum, has remained one of Tufts' most popular programs. </p>
							<p>In 1977, Tufts established a five-year joint degree program with the New England Conservatory of Music. Soon after, in 1979, a similar program began with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. Also in 1979, the Tufts Center for European Studies in Talloires, France, was established in an 11th Century priory. The Tufts European Center began operation soon after. </p>
							<p>In late 1979, Tufts made another important addition. In October, the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine opened at its original Boston campus. In 1980, the Grafton campus, built on the site of a state mental hospital, officially opened its doors.</p>
							<p>The last two major additions to Tufts University took place in 1980 and 1981. In 1980, the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, established with a large grant from the Sackler family, opened its doors on the Boston campus of the Tufts School of Medicine. In 1981, at the <placeName n="Medford Campus">Medford Campus</placeName>, Tufts celebrated the opening of the School of Nutrition Science and Policy. The school was the first of its kind in the nation. </p>
							<p>Since Tufts was officially established in 1852, it has continued to grow and expand in new directions. From its beginnings as a small liberal arts college through its expansion into a full-scale university, Tufts has maintained a strong academic tradition and a community feel. </p>

							<head>Tufts Weekly, 1895-1968</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:MS036:MS036.001.060.00001.03476"><head>Staff of the Tufts Weekly printing the most recent edition, ca. 1934-1935</head></figure>The Tufts Weekly, first published on October 8, 1895, served as a source for news, sports, and student affairs. It was transformed into the Observer in January, 1969.</p>
							<p>Prior to first issue of the Weekly, the monthly Tuftonian was the closest Tufts had to a campus newspaper. In early 1895, students in the Zeta Psi and Theta Delta Chi fraternities, feeling that the campus needed a weekly publication, decided to replace the Tuftonian with the Tufts Weekly. Originally, the Weekly was to include campus news and sports, and also contain literary works by students. The fraternities disagreed on the exact content of the paper, however, and it was decided that the Tuftonian should continue publication, acting as a literary magazine, whereas the Weekly would serve as a purely informational publication. </p>
							<p>Published first by the Tufts-operated Publishing Association, the first issues of the Weekly carried sports (always on the front page), news, and alumni affairs. Students were encouraged to subscribe to the Weekly at an annual cost of $1.50, or $2.00 if they also wanted to receive the Tuftonian. Many students signed up, but, unfortunately, few paid the subscription price. Over the next fifteen years, the Weekly slowly went into debt, mainly with the Somerville Journal Company, who had inherited printing duties from the Publishing Association. After finishing Volume 16 on June 21, 1911, the Weekly was forced to stop publishing due to lack of funds. </p>
							<p>Publication resumed on November 12, 1913, after students successfully petitioned the Trustees to subsidize the Weekly for two years. Trustees and students then solved the problem of unpaid subscription costs by including the cost of student publications as part of the College charges to enrolled students. This subsidy allowed the Weekly to continue publication without worry of debt problems with the Tufts Publishing Corporation, who now handled printing. </p>
							<p>The Weekly continued as the newspaper of record for Tufts students. In January of 1969, the name was changed to the Observer, to reflect the new bi-weekly publishing schedule. </p>

							<head>Tufts Wives Club, 1946-1955</head>
							<p> The Tufts Wives Club was established in conjunction with the construction of Stearns Village in order to provide a social outlet for the wives of the veterans who returned to Tufts on the G.I. Bill of Rights following World War II. </p>
							<p>Sparked by interest expressed at a welcoming tea, the Wives Club was formally organized on April 25, 1946, by Mrs. Leonard Carmichael and Mrs. Jan T. Friis. Their aim was to stimulate social interest among the wives of Tufts students. An executive board was established, consisting of officers and group chairmen, which guided the organizations activities. Membership numbered more than sixty women, limited to the wives of Tufts graduate and undergraduate students. General meetings were held once a month, when it was common practice for the women's husbands to study and watch the children while their wives were meeting. Most of the women were residents of Stearns Village, although a few resided in Boston and surrounding communities.</p>
							<p>Activities of the club included sewing classes, an evening bridge club, athletic groups,holiday parties, speaker presentations on campus, and a cooperative babysitting league. The league was organized as a bartering system among the wives, with the swapping of child care hours allowing the economically strapped couples to have an evening out without incurring greater financial burden. The organization was also the first to sponsor a Christmas party on campus during its first year of existence. These types of events were seen as a method of dispelling the probable loneliness and isolation experienced by the "book worm widows" of the scholarly veterans.</p>
							<p>The club's greatest contribution to the Tufts campus was the establishment of a cooperative day care system for the more than fifty children residing in the village. In 1949, this venture evolved into the Stearns Village Nursery School. In 1951, the licensed establishment was absorbed by the Boston Nursery Training School, which later became the Elliot-Pearson Children's School. </p>
							<p>Following the demolition of Stearns Village in 1955 and the subsequent relocation of families back into the surrounding communities, the Tufts Wives Club ceased to exist. </p>

The Yacht Club officially reorganized in 1939, with nine charter members drafting governing documents and registering with the Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association. Tufts' women students also entered two crews into the Women's Intercollegiate Sailing Regatta the same year. A boathouse for the club was erected in 1948 on Upper Mystic Lake, Medford, Massachusetts, with funds raised by an alumni advisory committee. The yacht club was charged with opening its resources and facilities to students, faculty, and staff for both competitive and leisure sailing activities.</p>
							<p>As of 2000, Tufts continues to use the facility located on Upper Mystic Lake, with the Tufts Sailing Team holding weekend regattas and regular practices at the location. </p>

							<head>Undergraduate Majors, 1894</head>
							<p> Beginning in 1894, undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences were required to complete a major concentration within their course of study toward the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree. Up until that time, students read a fixed curriculum leading toward the bachelor of arts based on the classical curriculum including Latin, Greek, rhetoric, mathematics, theology, political economy, and other subjects.</p>
							<p>The decision to institute majors within the curriculum was made to provide depth of knowledge to complement the breadth built into the traditional prescribed curriculum. It was felt that the system of electives offered alongside the traditional curriculum did not allow for the development of real knowledge in one field, instead resulting in a scattered acquaintance with a number of subjects. Though the major requirement did not go into effect until the Fall 1894 semester, it was offered as an option in 1893, with most students taking advantage of the new program at that time.</p>
							<p>The first majors offered were Biology, Chemistry, Engineering, English Literature, French, German, Greek, Latin, Mathematics, Physics, and Political Science. Engineering remained a major choice until 1911, when the College of Engineering was officially separated from the College of Liberal Arts. </p>

						<div2 type="entry" n="Vietnam War, 1966-1973" id="V00001">
							<head>Vietnam War, 1966-1973</head>
							<p> The war in Vietnam, from the start a controversial operation, ignited the emotions of young people at college campuses across the United States. Along with the Civil Rights movement, the Vietnam War served to create an air of radicalism among college-age youth, and led to an upsurge in activism and radical politics on college campuses. The Tufts campus was no exception. </p>
							<p>In 1966, students first began paying close attention to the war effort in Southeast Asia. At the time, however, about half of the student body was in favor of military action in Vietnam, and the majority felt that some type of action needed to be taken to halt the spread of communism in Asia. Within two years, these feelings would undergo a drastic shift, as Tufts students began to take part in anti-war activity both on and off campus. </p>
							<p>Student action against the war truly began with the spring 1967 formation of a chapter of the Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS. The Tufts chapter joined with other local students to protest in Boston, and began to sponsor various on campus seminars about the draft. Writing letters to the Tufts Weekly and distributing flyers across campus, the SDS called for greater student and faculty participation in deciding university policy, and also for the opportunity to take a more aggressive role in bringing about social change on campus. In March of 1967, the Tufts SDS participated in the "Spring Mobilization to End the War" by bringing prominent American Marxist and anti-war activist Herbert Aptheker to speak on campus. SDS then sponsored a five-week course on the "New Left," focusing on the radical politics developing among student groups. </p>
							<p>Controversy on campus expanded greatly during the fall of the same year. General Lewis B. Hershey, the director of the Selective Service System, called for the cancellation of student draft deferments for all students found expressing anti-war sentiments. After immediate pressure from students, Tufts president Burton C. Hallowell spoke out publicly against Hershey's policy, but refused to give in to student demands to ban recruitment on campus. In response, SDS set up a "War and Draft Information Center" in Packard Hall. In October, another group called Tufts Citizens Concerned About the War sponsored another forum about the war, bringing MIT professor Noam Chomsky to Tufts. At the forum, Chomsky detailed his anti-war views, all the while fending off hecklers. Soon after, three Tufts students participated in a mass return of draft cards in Boston. One student publicly burned his, while the other two simply passed theirs in. </p>
							<p>In November of 1967, Tufts saw its first major on-campus protest. The CIA and the Dow Chemical Company (who manufactured napalm) came to Tufts to recruit students, and were met with a large, but peaceful student protest. Soon after the CIA protest, the military sponsored a draft forum at Tufts to explain changes in draft laws and to try to calm students.</p>
							<p>1968 saw similar anti-war action throughout the campus. Upon their arrival at Tufts, freshmen were given anti-war pamphlets printed by the S.D.S., and early in the year, the student council voted 15-5-1 in favor of banning recruitment on campus. President Hallowell, however, continued to reject the ban. By now, student opinion had shifted, with polls showing sixty-one percent of the campus now favored some sort of de-escalation. The spring semester brought increased on-campus action. On April 16, 1969, classes were suspended for the afternoon in order to hold a campus wide ROTC referendum. Many students had protested the presence of ROTC offices on campus, and demanded an end to the program. At the forum, both the pros and cons of the program were discussed in an effort to reach some sort of consensus. Soon after the forum, however, the Tufts faculty voted that the ROTC be completely removed from campus by 1973. The decision angered many students and alumni, especially those who were veterans of foreign wars. Many felt that the faculty had turned their back on an important program. On campus, however, many students supported the decision. At the same time, ROTC students were subject to continuous harassment. Some were pelted with eggs and rotten vegetables when seen wearing their uniforms, and consequently many avoided campus altogether.</p>
							<p>On October 15, 1969, classes were suspended for one day to observe National Vietnam Peace Action Day. The Student Mobilization Committee, another anti-war group, organized an overnight vigil at Goddard Chapel, and also held numerous teach-ins and seminars throughout the day. A number of faculty spoke at different campus events during the day. Although the featured faculty differed slightly in their opinions about the war, all of them favored withdrawal from Vietnam. President Hallowell also declared his opposition to the war, but still refused to ban on-campus recruiting. </p>
							<p>Campus action continued in the spring of 1970. In March, a speech by David Dellinger of the Chicago Seven drew 1500 people, and in early April, a meeting of 600 students drew up plans for campus-wide action. The students passed five resolutions, including a call for a general strike for the remainder of the semester so that they could focus solely on anti-war activity. The meeting also called for the cancellation of finals and voiced support for a resolution passed at an informal and unofficial faculty meeting condemning the Nixon administration's escalation of the war and calling for immediate American withdrawal. Following the meeting, President Hallowell ordered the flag to be flown at half-mast through Memorial Day to recognize continuing death due to war across the world. The administration allowed the student strike to go unchallenged, and although classes were not officially cancelled, students, faculty, and the administration united in opposition to the war and held various seminars and discussions. </p>
							<p>The end of the semester saw perhaps the most severe campus action yet. On April 30, 300 students gathered in front of Ballou to protest the war. During the next couple of weeks, protest increased, ending with the suspension of finals for members of the senior class. In order to voice their opposition to the Nixon administration, the war, and the continued refusal of the Tufts administration to end recruitment activities on campus, the senior class organized a separate graduation ceremony. Instead of handing out programs, students handed flowers to parents and picked their own speakers. The students also declared that their ceremony was done in solidarity for the dead at Kent State and Jackson State colleges. The official ceremony, held one day later, drew almost noone.</p>
							<p>The fall of 1970 saw continued student action. The administration and faculty postponed all quizzes and exams until November so that students could participate in political action until the elections without harming their grades. Even with the suspension, the campus continued to experience major disruptions. In October, two bomb threats called in on the same day caused evacuations across campus. First, a threat was called in to Sweet Hall, the home of the ROTC offices. Next, a similar threat was made to the Fletcher School. All though both turned out to be hoaxes, they caused campus wide panic. Then, on October 23, a rally held in front of Ballou to protest the indictment of Kent State students drew a huge crowd. </p>
							<p>In the spring of 1971, another teach-in took place, with Noam Chomsky again serving as the featured speaker. Then, the most violent action of the entire war struck the Tufts campus. On March 21, 1971, at 4:30 in the morning, the Fletcher school was firebombed. The offices of Dean Gullion, the head of the school, were completely destroyed, along with the offices next door. Overall, the firebombing did between fifty and seventy five thousand dollars worth of damage. Although the perpetrators were never apprehended, it was generally assumed that the bombing was related to the war.</p>
							<p>1972 was the last year for major activity on campus. Early in the year, President Hallowell refused to make payroll deductions for medical aid to Indochine. His action caused a number of protests, especially after Jane Fonda came to campus and spoke in favor of medical aid. Parent's Weekend also became central for anti-war activity, with fifty parents and twenty faculty members signing a petition to Hallowell asking for the end of on campus recruiting. The last major protest to hit the Tufts campus came on October 27, 1972. Students gathered outside of Brown House to protest Marine recruiting. Although no students even signed up to be interviewed by the Marines, the protest continued as planned, eventually developing into a forum with the recruiting officers in the Brown House. The protest was cut short when a bomb threat was called in to Brown House. </p>
							<p>Overall, members of the Tufts community showed a great deal of concern about the war in Vietnam. Although the central activists on campus were few in number, their actions made their voices impossible to ignore. The war, however, caused a major disruption in alumni relations, especially with alumni of the ROTC program. Many saw the end of the ROTC program as the end of many qualified students' chances to afford a Tufts education, and also felt it was disrespectful to veterans of Vietnam and previous wars. Across the country, radical politics took hold of many universities, and Tufts was no exception. </p>

							<head>Washburn, Israel, Jr. 1813-83</head>
							<p>Israel Washburn Jr. (1813-1883), H1872, governor of Maine, was a member of the original Board of Trustees of Tufts College and later President of the Board. Washburn was honored with the degree of LL.D., in 1872.Three years later Washburn was offered the third Presidency of Tufts College.</p>
							<p>Washburn turned down the offer. In fact, he wrote to the Board of Trustees before they voted. He had seen his name offered as a candidate and attempted to forestall the vote. Despite his protests, the Board persisted and elected him president. Citing lack of time and qualifications, he formally refused the honor. His attendance record at Board meetings supports his argument - he was almost never there. His refusal may have stemmed from the strenuous and taxing period more than a decade before when Washburn served as a war-time Governor.</p>
							<p>It was a long road to the governorship. Born in Livermore, Maine, on June 6, 1813, Israel Washburn was the eldest of eleven children. He attended the common school before receiving several years of private instruction. A student of law, Washburn was admitted to the Penobscot bar in 1834, and opened his practice in Orono, Maine. In 1842 he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, and performed ably for some years in that position. He failed to secure a post in Congress in 1848, but prevailed in the 1850 election as a Whig. He served in Congress from 1851 until 1861.At that time he was elected Governor on the Republican ticket, a party he had joined immediately upon its creation.</p>
							<p>Worn out by his activities as Governor, in which capacity he had "outfitted regiment after regiment" of soldiers, he declined to run again. In gratitude, President Linclon appointed Washburn to the lucrative post of collector of the port of Portland, a position he held until 1877.In the years up until his death, Washburn was a popular lecturer, devoting proceeds to charitable organizations. Always active in literary pursuits, he was a member of the Maine Historical Society and published a memoir on Chief Justice Shepley, a volume of notes on Livermore, and a paper on the northeastern boundary question.</p>
							<p>As all of the founding members of Tufts were, Washburn was an active and well-known Universalist. He was a stern supporter of the policy that the president of Tufts College live on campus, and he urged the construction of a church on school grounds. The fulfillment of the latter consideration, the dedication of Goddard Chapel in 1883, nearly coincided with the date of his death.</p>
							<p>Israel Washburn Jr. died of an affliction of the heart on Saturday May 12, 1883, at the Lafayette Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

							<head>Wendell Phillips Memorial Scholarship, 1896</head>
							<p> The Wendell Phillips Memorial Scholarship is one of two scholarships (the other being assigned to Harvard College)which was established in 1896 by the Wendell Phillips Memorial Fund Association in honor of Boston's greatest preacher and orator. The scholarship is given annually to the junior or senior who has best demonstrated both marked ability as a speaker and a high sense of public responsibility. The recipient of the scholarship traditionally gives an address at commencement. Candidates for this award are recommended by the Committee on Student Life and are chosen through a series of public speeches presented at a campus-wide event.</p>
							<p>Wendell Phillips was born in Boston on November 29, 1811, graduated from Harvard in 1831, and went to Harvard Law School. He passed the bar in 1834 but soon concentrated his energies on the fight against slavery and left his professional practice in 1839. He became a public figure and the chief of American orators with his Faneuil Hall speech of Decembe r 8, 1837. In that speech, he rebuked the Massachusetts attorney general for having just derided E. P. Lovejoy, who had been murdered for defending freedom of the press against a pro-slavery mob in Alton, Illinois. Pointing to the portraits in the hall he said, "When I heard the gentleman lay down principles which placed the rioters, incendiaries and murderers of Alton side by side with Otis and Hancock, with Quincy and Adams, I thought these pictured lips would have broken into voice to rebuke the recreant American, the slanderer of the dead."</p>
							<p>He fought to keep the abolitionist movement open to participants of all faiths, and when slavery was finally abolished, continued the struggle for the education and enfranchisement of blacks. In 1870, after passage of the fifteenth amendment, he turned to the causes of native Americans and the Irish, and he worked for women's suffrage, improvements of criminal law and prison administration, as well as the regulation of liquor sales.</p>
							<p>As an orator he is placed with Daniel Webster and Edward Everett, and he changed the style of American oratory from rounded sonority to the easier colloquial style of modern day speechmaking. He died in Boston on February 2, 1884. </p>

Wessell, who ushered Tufts into its second century, the Wessell Library was constructed in 1964-65 to replace Eaton Library as the library for Arts and Sciences on the Medford campus.</p>
							<p>Construction began in January 1964, following a design competition sponsored by the university and sanctioned by the American Institute of Architects. Four Boston firms participated in the competition, with Campbell, Aldrich and Nulty being chosen as the firm to design the university's new library. The building, recessed into the hillside, spanned 95,000 square feet. The project's total cost was over $2.9 million upon its completion and dedication in September 1965.</p>
							<p>Wessell Library contained faculty studies, seminar rooms, the Mark Memorial Lounge, areserve reading room, as well as significantly increased stack space and modern study facilities. The library served Arts and Sciences for more than thirty years, until 1997, when the Tisch Library opened. Tisch Library is built around and encompasses the original Wessell Library structure in a significantly expanded facility. </p>

							<p> WGI began broadcasting as experimental radio station 1XE in 1914, and staked out a place in history as one of the first radio stations to go on the air in the United States.</p>
							<p>Tufts graduate Harold Power, A1914, held a lifelong interest in radio, and after his graduation formed the American Radio and Research Corporation, which soon became known as AMRAD. Power bought land on the Tufts hillside, and built a 304-foot radio tower and studio. The government assigned Power's new station the call letters 1XE, as radio broadcasting was still considered experimental. When it went on the air, 1XE became one of the first two broadcasting stations in the United States. </p>
							<p>By 1916, Power had begun broadcasting recorded music over 1XE. At that point, ham radio operators were the station's main listeners, as radio had not yet caught on. By the spring of 1921, however, radio was becoming more popular, and 1XE was the first station in the country to broadcast on a daily schedule. 1XE's programming included music, nightly police reports, and even bedtime stories. </p>
							<p>In January, 1922, Power finally applied for and received a commercial license, and the station's call letters became WGI. By March, WGI was broadcasting the first radio newscasts in Boston, and was becoming quite a popular station. During the next couple of years, WGI expanded its programming to include local celebrities and politicians, and began airing the "Big Brother Club," a children's show that would have a forty-five year run on radio and, later, television. </p>
							<p>Unfortunately, AMRAD, WGI's backing company, was relatively unprofitable. Although known for its technological innovations, AMRAD was seen as unreliable, and began to flounder by 1924. WGI, at that point trying to compete with upstart radio stations with corporate backing, could not afford the new equipment needed to remain a premier station. By 1924 it was lagging behind competitors and losing talent to other Boston stations. </p>
							<p>In the spring of 1925, Power declared bankruptcy, and WGI went off the air in May. Although Power searched for new backers, WGI never went back on the air. Power eventually sold the AMRAD land back to Tufts. The radio tower, however, did receive further use, broadcasting the programming of WBET, the Boston Evening Transcript's station, in 1927, after the station realized that the tower's high elevation would help its low wattage signal reach larger areas. </p>

							<p>Born in Woodbury, Vermont, on July 6, 1851, Wheatley graduated from Dartmouth College in 1879. Before leaving the college in 1884, he also obtained his masters and medical degrees. Moving to North Abington, Massachusetts, Wheatley soon became active in his new community, serving as an officer in several professional institutions and civic organizations. He held the position of Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the School for the Feeble Minded at Waverly for 20 years. In 1886, Wheatley married Nellie J. Holbrook, with whom he had five sons. A member of both the state's House of Representatives and Senate at the turn of the century, Wheatley continued his medical interests as a lecturer on Materia Medica and Therapeutics at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston. In 1893, he joined the Tufts Medical School faculty during the school's first year. In 1914, he was appointed vice-dean, assuming the role of dean for one year beginning in 1921.He also taught as Professor of Pharmacology at the School of Medicine of Boston University from 1918-1920.

							<head>White, Zebulon Lewis, 1842-89</head>
							<p>Zebulon L. White (1842-1889), A1866, was a distinguished journalist and trustee of Tufts College. Tufts' second President A.A. Miner, in dedication to White, wrote, "The College reckons many noble men in the catalogue of its alumni, but none truer or nobler than Zebulon Lewis White."</p>
							<p>White was born in Norton, Massachusetts, on July 23, 1842.He worked in a foundry as a young boy, and later as a laborer on a farm. He struggled mightily to obtain a college education and first came to the Hill with his younger brother G. Penn White in 1862. </p>
							<p>After graduation, White wrote some freelance articles for a temperance journal. By 1867 he had joined the city staff of the New York Tribune, and moved quickly up the ranks. In 1869 White obtained a transfer to Washington as chief of the Tribunes' correspondence bureau, a position he held for over a decade. One of the exciting events of this period stemmed from his publication of the Washington Treaty (1871) in advance of its official dissemination. The Senate promptly imprisoned White for contempt, as he refused to reveal the source of his information.</p>
							<p>This and similar episodes, though less colorful, are testaments to White's integrity and character, aspects noted by his contemporaries with awe. He was well-known for his loyalty, garnering him the confidence and esteem of Washington politicians who habitually distrusted members of the press. One obituary writer eulogized "he put himself, without pretension or reservation, into whatever he undertook."White's persistence and powers of retention were legend among his fellow classmates and colleagues. They observed that he was not the man who learned immediately what he wished, but rather he acquired the knowledge over time, and once in his head it was there for good.</p>
							<p>From the Times, White moved on to the editorship of The Providence Press. From this publication he resigned, begging poor health, but he rallied briefly to contribute articles to The North American Review, Harpers Magazine, and other similar publications.</p>
							<p>Zebulon L. White married twice, each time to a daughter of M.J. Drummond, and in his religious faith he was a Universalist.</p>
							<p>At Tufts White was an ardent member of the Mathetican Society, a brother in Zeta Psi, and he used to take a notebook to sermons at Goddard Chapel in order to record them - practice for his career. He retained a powerful appreciation for his alma mater, and gladly served as Trustee from 1872 until his death seventeen years later.</p>
							<p>In failing health, White and his family boarded ship to Bermuda in hopes of regaining his strength. Unfortunately he died within three weeks of his arrival, in the early morning hours of January 1, 1889.</p>

He was also the first person to receive an honorary degree at Tufts.</p>
							<p>Whittemore, born on January 1, 1800, in Boston, was remembered as a mischievous youth, bouncing between a number of apprenticeships before settling in as apprentice to Abel Baker, a boot-maker in Boston. In 1820, the last year of his apprenticeship, Whittemore began to gain interest in the Universalist faith, under the guidance of Hosea Ballou, Sr. Ballou had been renting a room from Baker, and began to aid Whittmore in furthering his education. Ballou convinced Whittemore to become a member of the Universalist clergy, and within a year, Whittmore had been confirmed as a reverend. During the next twenty years, Whittemore became an active and distinguished member of the Universalist community, working first as a joint editor of "Universalist" magazine, and then as sole editor of the magazine's successor, "The Trumpet." Whittemore also published a much-acclaimed book, "A Modern History of Universalism". He was elected to the State Legislature in Massachusetts, representing Cambridge, and served as a selectman and as alderman in Cambridge.</p>
							<p>In the early 1850s, Whittemore became involved in the founding of Tufts College, serving as Vice President of the Board of Trustees. He worked to raise funds necessary to build the college, and attended the laying of the first cornerstone. Whittemore also spoke on opening day at Tufts, introducing the College's first president, Hosea Ballou. Whittemore was featured as a speaker at the first and second commencement exercises at Tufts, in 1857 and 1858 respectively. He was presented with an honorary Doctor of Divinity at commencement in 1858. </p>
							<p>In September, 1921, prior to his work with Tufts, Whittemore had married Lovice Corbett and over the next seventeen years, they had eight children. </p>

							<head>Wiener, Norbert, 1894-1964</head>
							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.01544"><head> Dr. Norbert Wiener, A'1909 and H'1946, June 1946</head></figure>Norbert Wiener (1894-1964), A1909, was a world renowned mathematician and founder of the science of cybernetics. He formulated some of the most important contributions to mathematics in the 20th century. He was a child prodigy who graduated from Tufts in 1909 at the age of fourteen.</p>
							<p>Wiener was born on November 26, 1894, in Columbia, Missouri. He moved with his family to Massachusetts while still an infant, where his father became professor of Slavonic languages and literature at Harvard University. His father personally took charge of his son's education, and Wiener did not attend school until attending the high school in Ayer, Massachusetts, near his family's home in the rural town of Harvard, Massachusetts.</p>
							<p>Wiener enrolled at Tufts in 1906 and earned his degree in mathematics in 1909, at which point he went on to Harvard to study zoology. However, when he found that laboratory work was not his strength, he changed his course of study to philosophy, at his father's suggestion. He completed a Ph. D. in the subject at Harvard in 1913, at age 18, with a dissertation in mathematical logic.</p>
							<p>Wiener then travelled abroad to the universities of Cambridge and Gottingen, where he studies under Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, respectively. He published his first paper on mathematics in the Messenger of Mathematics in 1913 just as World War I broke out. He tried to enlist but was rejected for poor eyesight.</p>
							<p>After working at a number of different jobs for several years, Wiener was hired as an instructor in the mathematics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The department at the time had no tradition of scholarship or research, but Wiener directed the growth of the program, eventually becoming one of the most famous members of the institution's faculty.</p>
							<p>During those years Wiener did highly innovative and fundamental work on what is now called a stochastic process and, in particular, on the theory of Brownian motionthat is, the construction of a rigorous mathematical description of a physical process that is subject to random changeand on generalized harmonic analysisthat is, the analysis of functions into periodic components and the generalizations of such an analysisas well as significant work on other problems of mathematical analysis. From a long list of published works, three papers stand out: "Differential Space," Journal of Mathematics and Physics, 58:131-174 (1923); "Generalized Harmonic Analysis," Acta Mathematica, 55:117-258 (1930); and "Tauberian Theorems," Annals of Mathematics, 33:1-100 (1932). In 1933 Wiener was elected to the National Academy of Science but soon resigned, repelled by some of the aspects of institutionalized science he encountered in the Academy. In the same year, he shared the B&#x00F4;cher Prize, offered every five years by the American Mathematical Society, and was honoured by the society by being invited to present the Colloquium Lectures, published (1934) as Fourier Transforms in the Complex Domain, with Raymond E.A.C. Paley (American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications, vol. 19). Much of the work appearing in this volume had been done in collaboration with Paley, who was killed a year before the book was finished. </p>
							<p>During World War II Wiener worked on gunfire control, the problem of pointing a gun to fire at a moving target. The ideas that evolved led to Extrapolation, Interpolation, and Smoothing of Stationary Time Series (1949), which first appeared as a classified report and established Wiener as a codiscoverer, with the Russian mathematician A.N. Kolmogorov, of the theory on the prediction of stationary time series. It introduced certain statistical methods into control and communications engineering and exerted great influence in these areas. This work also led him to formulate the concept of cybernetics.</p>
							<p>In 1948 his book Cybernetics: or, Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine appeared. For a scientific book it was extremely popular, and Wiener became known in a much broader scientific community. Cybernetics isinterdisciplinary in nature; based on common relationships between humans and machines, it is used today in control theory, automation theory, and computer programs to reduce many time-consuming computations and decision-making processes formerly done by human beings. Wiener worked at cybernetics, philosophized about it, and propagandized for it the rest of his life, all the while keeping up his research in other areas of mathematics. </p>
							<p>After the war Wiener continued to contribute new ideas to widely divergent subjects, including mathematical prediction theory and quantum theory, providing the latter a possible solution to a difficulty that had been debated by the physicists Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein. Applying his theoretical description of Brownian movement to quantum phenomena, he showed how quantum theory, to the extent that it is based on probability, is consistent with other branches of science. A few weeks before his death, Wiener was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Lyndon B. Johnson. </p>
							<p>Wiener died on March 18, 1964, in Stockholm, Sweden. </p>

Professor Wyatt was a teacher of Greek at Tufts from 1914 until his death in 1961, and chairman of the classics department from its establishment in 1940 to 1952.</p>
							<p>William Frank Wyatt was born in Carrollton, Kentucky. He graduated from Centre College in 1904, taught school, and became instructor of Latin at Transylvania College for four years. From 1910 to 1915 he studied for a doctorate at Harvard and in 1912 and 1913 held a European fellowship. In 1914, he joined Tufts as an Instructor of Greek. In 1918, he became assistant professor, and in 1924, professor. He also taught courses in Greek history, sculpture, and mythology, and gave a New Testament course at the Crane School of Religion. While he was chairman of the Greek Department, the professorship of Latin became vacant and both departments were merged into the Department of Classics. The only interruption of his service to Tufts occurred when he was in charge of the YMCA headquarters at Turin in Italy during World War I.</p>
							<p>He married a classicist, Natalie Gifford, after the age of 50 and became emeritus professor of Greek in 1952. He continued to teach as a lecturer in Classics for another four years. He lived on Edison Avenue in Medford until his death on July 28, 1961. </p>

							<p> Harold Williams (1853-1926), H1905, served as the Tufts College Medical School's third dean (1891-1913) and professor of Disease of Children and professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine.</p>
							<p>Williams was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on December 5, 1853. He attended Brookline High School and Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1878. He spent the following two years travelling and working in Europe. He returned to Boston in 1880, establishing his own practice and serving as physician to the Boston Dispensary. </p>
							<p>From 1894 to 1899, Williams was professor of Disease of Children at Tufts Medical School and chairman of the Committee of Health and Physical Training at Wellesley College. In 1897, he was elected president of the staff of the Boston Dispensary and the following year was made a trustee of the Boston Dental College. </p>
							<p>Williams served as dean of Tufts' medical and dental schools from 1898 to 1913. He also held the position of professor of the Theory and Practice of Medicine during this time. Tufts awarded Williams an honorary doctor of laws degree in 1905, in recognition of his distinction as a surgeon and physician. In 1913, Williams resigned from Tufts Medical School. He was later appointed to the Visiting Committee of the Harvard Medical School. </p>
							<p>Williams held several positions and affiliations within both national and local medical organizations, including chairman of the Committee on Excursions of the American Medical Association and President of the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. He was also appointed by Massachusetts' Governor Guild to a committee to prepare a circular of advice to school physicians in 1907.</p>
							<p>Williams was a noted rope-climber, winning a gold medal at the world's championship for the sport in March 1890.He also won the Boston Athletic Association Championship for the same feat, climbing 35 feet in 12.6 seconds.</p>
							<p>He and his wife, Alice Cary, whom he married in 1876, had four children. He died on April 3, 1926, in St. Augustine, Florida. </p>

							<head>Wilson, George Grafton, 1863-1951</head>
							<p> George Grafton Wilson (1863-1951) was a distinguished scholar of International Law and a member of the Fletcher School faculty from 1933 to 1951. </p>
							<p>Wilson started his career as a lecturer at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1900, but gained most of his fame as a professor of international law at Harvard University, where he began in 1910. He served as one of America's delegates to the Naval Conference in London in 1905, and also wrote and co-wrote a series of books detailing the specifics of international law. </p>
							<p>In 1925, with the first grant from Austin Fletcher's will, work began at Tufts University to appoint a faculty for the new Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Although a separate school had not yet been established, Tufts hired Wilson as lecturer in international law in the Fletcher School for the 1926-1927 school year. He was unable to return the following year, but was rehired as a professor of public and international law for the school's official opening in 1933. Still a professor at Harvard, Wilson was deeply involved in the early debates about the level of influence Harvard would have at the still-developing Fletcher School. </p>
							<p>Wilson became known as a dignified and serious professor, who used current cases to engage his students. After 1938, Wilson was designated Special Lecturer in International Law, and would remain with Fletcher until his death on May 2, 1951. </p>
							<p>Wilson left his mark on Tufts University. The men's dormitory at the Fletcher School was named in his honor, and he donated his vast library of over 1,000 documents and 1,400 manuscripts to the Ginn Library, where it remains as the George Grafton Wilson Collection in International Law. </p>

							<p>Wilson House, located at 136 Curtis Street on the Medford campus, was constructed in 1908 and purchased by Tufts in 1936.The house was purchased to serve as a residence for male students of the Fletcher School and was named in honor of George Grafton Wilson, one of the original members of the school's faculty.</p>
							<p>After being purchased by Tufts, a large addition designed by Andrews, Jones, Biscoe, and Whitmore, was made to the original structure. Male Fletcher students occupied the house until World War II, when it became a residence for female Fletcher students and students of the Bouve-Boston School.</p>
							<p>The Fletcher School turned Wilson House over to Arts and Sciences in 1962, with the completion of Mugar Hall. Since that time Wilson House has served as an undergraduate residence. </p>

							<p>The first official act of the college recognizing the possibility that the United States might become involved in the war in Europe had occurred in May 1916 when over 1,000 students, faculty, and alumni had participated in a giant Preparedness Parade in downtown Boston. Early in 1917 the faculty created a special Committee on Preparedness; its first act was to take a census of the student body to see what special qualifications might be available for national service. Almost a month before President Woodrow Wilson delivered his war message to Congress, the Tufts faculty had voted unanimously to allow up to three term hours of credit for satisfactory completion of a military training course having one lecture, two hours of recitation, and five hours of drill a week.</p>
							<p>On the very day that Wilson delivered his fateful message, the faculty on the Hill voted to recommend to the Trustees that seniors in good standing called into service were to be given their appropriate degree at the June commencement. Full credit would be given for the half-year if undergraduates were called into service. With commendable foresight the faculty also provided that for students returning to the college after the war, arrangements would be made "as though no interruption had taken place and that the advanced subjects will be adjusted to meet these conditions."Tufts joined other Massachusetts colleges in liberalizing the entrance requirements for students whose secondary school preparation had been interrupted for military for agricultural service, and War Certificates were awarded, starting in 1918, to seniors who had accepted a "Call to the Colors." The faculty, looking to the immediate emergency, then created a committee on National Service to arrange for cooperation with the national and state governments. They also voted to petition both the President of the United States and Congress to prohibit "the manufacture and sale of all intoxicating liquors during the period of the war, as a logical and necessary conservation measure." Trustee Fletcher's hopes that alcoholic beverages would disappear seemed to have received official support.</p>
							<p>The summer of 1918 was an exceptionally busy one for the college. The institution went on an around-the-clock schedule, offering special "War Emergency Courses" for civilians in chemistry, industrial electricity, and civil engineering. Probably no one in the Tufts community lived a more hectic civilian life that summer than President Bumpus. On the importuning of officials in Washington, he became chief of the Organization Branch, Methods Control Division, of the Quartermaster Corps. In his work with the transportation division in particular he showed his unusual administrative abilities. He had already helped to organize and develop the War Department Committee on Education and Special Training, and as an ardent supporter of the Allied cause decided that if he could "be of greater service by leaving the college and going to Washington to undertake a piece of constructive work, I propose to go." He found his duties at Tufts "very confining" and earnestly wanted to be of greater service to the war effort than he thought that his tasks at the College provided. Keeping in touch with Tufts affairs and maintaining an office in the nation's capital simultaneously was a demanding assignment. As he wrote a friend at the Museum of Natural History, he was "spreading [his] time rather thin at Tufts and thick at Washington."When he returned to Tufts in the fall of 1918, he was called upon time after time to speak in the Greater Boston area on subjects "pertaining to our War situation," and he complied whenever time and energy permitted. Among his most widely reprinted speeches was "The Demand of the Government for Efficient Men."</p>
							<p>When autumn came, there were already on the Hill, or in the planning stage, an Army Collegiate Section of 500 men, an Army Vocational Section of 230 men, a Naval Section of 100 men, and at the Boston branch of the college a War Training Section of 900 men, all under the command of a major and eleven lieutenants. The first actually to arrive on the Hill (May 1918) was a contingent of 100 men to receive special training as carpenters, machinists, and automotive maintenance men. This group, one of many assigned to numerous colleges across the country, was under the Army Vocational Section and was known as the Tufts Training Detachment. The group was allotted to Tufts in response to a request of the Committee on Education and Special Training which President Bumpus had helped to organize and one of whose members was Samuel P. Capen, of the Class of 1898.The trainees were to remain at the college for sixty days and to receive military as well as technical instruction. It was this group that built an extension to the Howe Memorial Laboratory (the Power House) and constructed a separate building used for automotive training. A second group (150 men) arrived in mid-June, and the campus hummed with activity.</p>
							<p>In the meantime, a new project was undertaken by the federal government which involved Tufts directly, although briefly. A Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) had been established under the authority of the National Defense Act of 1916.By mid-1917 it was operating at thirty-seven colleges (mostly land-grant) and nine military and other schools. The Tufts faculty recommended in June that President Bumpus and the Trustees "consider the advisability of establishing a Reserve Officers Training Corps at Tufts College."Instead, the College received units of the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), which was organized in the late summer of 1918 to take the place temporarily of the ROTC.The purpose of the SATC was to train enlisted men for special military assignments. After a twelve-weeks' term, men from each unit were to be sent to officers' training campus, non-commissioned officer' schools, or cantonments, or were assigned to assist in instructing others at SATC units.</p>
							<p>When word was received that the War Department was organizing units of the SATC at selected colleges, Tufts immediately applied for a unit. By October the Hill was covered with marching men in military uniforms and draftees in fatigue clothing being trained under the Army Vocational program.<placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName>, ordinarily housing about sixty-five men, became a bustling barracks for 320. <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> was remodeled as a mess hall in which 750 men could be served at one time. Jumbo, the College Mascot, was boarded up in one corner of Barnum Museum, and his first-floor quarters became a post exchange. Part of the upper floor of the building became the distributing center for Quartermaster supplies. Goddard Gymnasium became a YMCA furnishing entertainment and social amenities for the 238 students in the SATC.Part of Eaton Library was set aside as barracks, and a reading and writing room was provided in it for the use of military personnel. The facilities of the Crane School were used by the SATC while theological classes met at Dean McCollester's residence. The housing and feeding of pre-medical, medical, and dental students in the War Training Program in downtown Boston were made possible by the lease and conversion of Mechanics Hall, which provided facilities for 900 men. Captain Milton S. Bowman, who had been assigned to the Tufts Training Detachment in May 1918, was promoted to the rank of major and was placed in charge of thee whole military operation at Tufts. Dean Anthony of the engineering school directed War Training Courses on the Hill, and Dean Wren of the school of liberal arts directed the equivalent for the departments in Boston.</p>
							<p>The war crept into every nook and cranny of the Tufts campus. Soon after the United States entered the conflict, the college organized a course of weekly lectures required of all students. Academic credit could be earned if students presented within a week a written synopsis of each lecture and showed "some acquaintance with the subject and its literature."There were talks on such subjects as food conservation, the League to Enforce Peace, and relief work in Belgium and Poland. A special secretarial course was introduced for Jackson Students, who could also receive college credit for Red Cross-sponsored courses in nursing and first aid. Many a Tufts student and faculty member shivered through the winter months as fuel conservation was rigidly enforced, and many a waistline was presumably trimmed by those who followed Herbert Hoover's "Gospel of the Clean Plate."Many students paid their College charges with United States Government bonds purchased by their patriotic parents.</p>
							<p>Scarcely had the college made the abrupt transition from an academic institution to a quasi-military establishment When six weeks later it had to change gears again. The SATC began training in mid-October, after the opening of the college had been delayed by an influenza epidemic. The armistice was signed less than a month later. The immediate post-armistice status of the SATC unit gave as much trouble as any single activity. No one seemed to know from day to day (either in Washington or at Tufts) when the program would be liquidated, except that the financial obligations to the college would eventually be met by the government. There was a "strong probability" in November 1918 that students enrolled in the SATC program would "be given the privilege of returning to civil life if they so elect." This seemed to treasurer Arthur Mason to make Tufts' difficulties in formulating any plans all the greater, for he assumed that most of the men released from the SATC would "simply go" and would not transfer to other courses in the college. On November 27, orders were received to demobilize the SATC as soon as possible. The college had the opportunity in the winter of 1918 to consider the establishment of an ROTC unit following the disbanding of the SATC but the Executive Committee "deemed it not advisable." In December, demobilization had been completed and the college found itself in the unenviable position of trying to resume a peacetime stance almost literally overnight. Somehow, in little more than two weeks, it managed to reconvert itself into an academic institution in time to open for the second semester in January 1919. </p>
							<p>The disarrrangements resulting from a nation at war and from demobilization, reconversion, and a general return to the status quo ante bellum after November 11, 1918, had innumerable repercussions on the campus, some involving serious financial problems. The fraternities, whose houses had been closed or taken over by the College and who wanted a home on the campus again, had to renegotiate their property arrangements. Typical were the problems faced by Zeta Psi when the Trustees at first decided in the fall of 1918 to terminate the fraternity occupancy of the house located at the corner of Professors Row and Packard Avenue, but later changed their minds. The Delta Tau Delta house had been taken over by the SATC as an infirmary, and the Delta Upsilon house had served as a Jackson dormitory. The student body, although it did not disintegrate, did shrink noticeably in the fall of 1918, and with it went precious revenue. Faculty by the dozens (especially the medical and dental school staffs) became involved in military obligations and were given leaves of absence without pay; at the same time, the question arose of how to occupy the remaining faculty. The expenses involved in adapting the buildings on the campus to military use were complicated by the fact that the cash balance in the college coffers toward the end of 1918 was "almost zero," according to a report of Arthur Mason, the harried treasurer. Government compensation to the college ($1.6481 per day for each SATC student on the Hill and $1.5555 for those quartered in Boston) came in long after services had been rendered. Treasurer Mason, in September 1918, predicted that the college would have to have a loan of nearly $200,000 to meet its immediate obligations; he had already been forced to borrow $25,000 to meet current expenses. The most crucial period in the wartime history of the college came when the demobilization of the SATC was ordered and before any estimate could be made of how many students would register after the military contingents withdrew.</p>
							<p>The enrollment in midyear of 1918-19, when the College suddenly returned to peacetime status, exceeded all expectation. Jackson College, whose enrollments had increased during the war, set a new record with 174 enrolled, and created an acute housing problem which was alleviated by converting the president's house into a dormitory. The most astounding statistics were for the school of liberal arts and for the engineering school. There were 521 students in all in the two schools by January 1919, including approximately fifty who had already returned from military service to resume their interrupted studies. Over 900 students registered in the pre-medical, medical, and dental schools. The author of a feature article in the Tufts College Graduate gave the lion's share of the credit for the prosperous condition of the institution to President Bumpus. He cited enrollment and financial figures to support his enthusiastic statement that the president had "made good,"and said that if it had not been for his leadership and executive ability, the college might have foundered. Bumpus had apparently set it on the road to new heights and had fully vindicated his promise to make Tufts of maximum service "to the community and mankind."</p>
							<p>Over 1,000 Tufts men served in the armed forces during the First World War. Twenty-one lost their lives in the nation's service, of whom fifteen were commissioned officers. Many received citations for bravery, including the Distinguished Service Cross. If the members of the SATC who received their training at Tufts are counted, the total manpower contributions of the college were most impressive. Over two-thirds of the regular Tufts students, faculty, and alumni, ranging from the Class of 1878 through the Class of 1921, served in the Army; there were over 200 in the Navy; and a few served in the Marines. More than half of the Tufts men who served in some capacity were from the medical and dental schools. In addition to those in the regular armed forces, over 100 individuals were in various branches of auxiliary services such as the American Ambulance Field Service, the Red Cross, and the YMCA.</p>
							<p>Several arrangements growing out of the war continued into peacetime. The YMCA remained on the Hill for another year, financed by a joint appropriation from the college and from the funds of the Crane School. David Cheney, the general secretary of the YMCA at the college, became Tufts' first Director of Publicity in 1920. The dental school provided instruction in dental mechanics to disabled veterans by arrangement with the Federal Board for Vocational Education. </p>

							<p> <figure n="tufts:central:dca:UA136:UA136.002.DO.00473"><head>Student Body taking exams in Cousens Gym during World War II, ca. 1943</head></figure>Unenviable as the distinction may have been, President Carmichael shared with President Bumpus the tremendous responsibility of seeing the College through a world war. Though the involvement of the institution in the great conflict between 1917 and 1919 had been great, it bore only a surface resemblance to the degree of participation and the effects on the College of the second world war. Probably few institutions of higher education in the United States threw themselves more completely into the war effort. It was largely through President Carmichael's leadership and energy that so much was accomplished.</p>
							<p>It appeared in the fall of 1939 that once again the nation and Tufts College might have to face the possibility of another world war. President Carmichael was among those who sensed the impending crisis. He confessed reluctance to discuss the question of preparedness at Tufts for such an eventuality but felt that it should be faced. A number of the science departments at the College were already in communication with various agencies in Washington to develop research and study programs that might "be useful in case an emergency does arise." Preliminary steps were also taken to participate in a program of college training for pilots sponsored by the Civil Aeronautics Authority. This did not have a direct connection with military preparedness but it did have important implications for the whole problem of national manpower. Late in 1939 the Trustees authorized the signing of a contract between the United States Government and the College which would utilize the institution's resources in certain phases of pilot training. The program was placed under the supervision of the dean of the engineering school, and during the 1939-40 school year twenty students received primary training. There was a class of thirty in the summer of 1940. A second group of twenty was enrolled in the fall of 1940, and advanced training was provided as the students progressed. Forty-six of the first fifty students enrolled in the preliminary training program at Tufts completed all of the ground and flight tests and received private pilot's certificates. Between 1939 and 1943, when the CAA pilot training program came to an end, 398 students completed their basic training at Tufts.</p>
							<p>The engineering school was also actively contributing to national preparedness in another area by 1940. In that year the United States Office of Education organized a nation-wide Engineering Defense Training Program to provide specialized instruction in fields considered essential for national defense. The Tufts Engineering School, by the end of the academic year 1940-41, had offered such training to over 650 individuals through both full-time day courses and part-time evening courses. The program was extended the next year to science and management training, and by the fall of 1942 the number of enrollees had totaled over 1,200 in some forty courses. By the time the Engineering Science and War Management Training Program was terminated, in June 1945, some 2,000 enrollees had received college-level engineering courses at Tufts. The individuals were not degree candidates at Tufts but were, for the most part, graduates of colleges and technical schools who were employed in business and defense industries. Simultaneously, the engineering school undertook other special programs involving government-sponsored research which remained classified information through the war period.</p>
							<p>As pilot training under the direction of the engineering school continued, faculty members in various departments began to be called to national service, although the enactment of the Selective Service Act of 1940 and enlistment in the armed forces had no initial effect on undergraduate registrations in 1940-41. A few students were called into the National Guard, and a few more enlisted in officer training courses, but their places were taken by other students from a rapidly growing waiting list for college entrance. When war finally involved the United States directly, President Carmichael was adamant that the total resources of the College be turned to the nation's service. In his report to the Trustees in the fall of 1942 he made his views crystal clear: "The present goal for Tufts is to use the important resources of the College for the good of the United States. [Tufts] must in this year of our nation's desperate need be dedicated wholeheartedly to one aim and one aim only, that of serving the total war effort of our nation as effectively as possible."</p>
							<p>As early as the fall of 1939, the president had raised the question of whether facilities comparable to the Student Army Training Corps (SATC) operative during the First World War might be organized if it again became necessary to train large numbers of troops rapidly. He reminded the Trustees of the effective part played in this capacity by the college in the earlier conflict, when the Tufts contingent was rated as one of the five most effective units of the SATC in the United States. The first step to carry out Carmichael's suggestion was taken in 1941, when he requested the Navy Department to allocate an ROTC unit to the college. The request was honored, and Tufts became one of eight colleges in the United States granted a unit beginning in 1941-42. The headquarters of what was at first known as the Navy V-12 Program was installed on the second floor of a portion of the old AMRAD wing in <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName>. It began operations with three commissioned officers and a non-commissioned staff, and 100 students - the initial limit set by the Navy. Enrollment in the new unit was limited to freshmen in the schools of liberal arts and engineering, who were scheduled to take one course each year for four years in the Department of Naval Science and Tactics. After completing undergraduate instruction and passing appropriate examinations, the graduates were eligible to receive commissions as ensigns in the United States Naval Reserve or as second lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps Reserve. Membership in the unit was to be voluntary, but President Carmichael was positive that all students who met the physical qualifications would wish to join. The addition of this unit justified the admission of extra students. During 1940-41, before the NROTC unit was established, over fifty students had qualified and had been recommended for reserve commissions as officers in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. Several had also taken the Platoon Leaders' course in the Marine Corps and were destined to participate in the famous Guadalcanal campaign. Unlike the intention of the federal government during the First World War with its short-lived SATC to train junior line officers, the policy some thirty years later was to concentrate on preparing technically trained personnel. Hence Tufts, in the early days of the war effort, had much less the appearance of an armed camp, and there was a deliberate attempt to integrate military units into the life of the college. Courses for the four-year sequence in Naval Science and Tactics were adopted by the faculty of liberal arts and Jackson in the spring of 1941, subject to review and revision by the Navy Department. In order to point up the fact that the Naval unit was not isolated from the institution, a Committee of Visitors to the new department was created by the Trustees almost immediately.</p>
							<p>The college was informed in the spring of 1943 that it was being assigned 1,000 uniformed Naval trainees, to be enrolled in one of four special programs. The basic course, known as the V-12 Program until June 1946, included both Naval training and advanced work in selected courses in the school of liberal arts. There were also special curricula for engineers and pre-medical and pre-dental students, as well as for the regular NROTC unit. All of the Naval programs were in full operation on the campus by July 1943, and a School for War Service was organized to administer them. When the college received its quota of 225 Naval students in engineering in 1944, President Carmichael reported to the Trustees with great pride that this represented the third largest quota of any NROTC program among the twenty-seven educational institutions then participating. He went on to point out that Tufts had, by then, trained more men directly from civilian life for commissions in the Naval Reserve than had any other New England college.</p>
							<p>Even as the Second World War was coming to an end, it had been decided that an NROTC unit would be established permanently at the college. After the war, the Navy merged its wartime V-12 Program with NROTC units established in fifty colleges throughout the country, of which Tufts was one. Under the new program the college's quota was 571 in the fall of 1945. Students in the Naval unit were to be enrolled for a full four years. Although they could obtain the necessary number of credits for a Tufts degree, Naval requirements were such that they could not at first meet the college's foundation, distribution, and major requirements. The problem was resolved by awarding the degree of Bachelor of Naval Science to NROTC students who earned the required number of credits and completed also modified foundation and major requirements. It was anticipated (and correctly) that this expedient would be only temporary, for there was general feeling among both civilian educators and those responsible for the Navy curricula that the latter's requirements were too narrow and would soon be broadened. The Navy readjusted its program, and the special Bachelor's degree was not needed after June 1946.</p>
							<p>The Naval ROTC, which had been, in President Carmichael's words, "an absolute lifesaver for Tufts" during the war, was not only continued but expanded after 1945. There were almost 300 Naval students in either the "regular" or the "contract" program in the fall of 1951. At the same time, a new Air Force ROTC unit, for which President Carmichael had applied in 1949, was in operation with over 300 enrolled. Simultaneously, Army ROTC units continued in the medical and dental schools. During the Korean military crisis in 1951 almost 70 per cent of the male students in liberal arts and engineering were enrolled in one or the other of the two programs on the Hill, and Dean Burden of the engineering school served as liaison officer for the college. Space was at such a premium for the administrative staffs of the two units that the Trustees, in the fall of 1952, authorized the construction of a building for their use.</p>
							<p>Dr. Carmichael was the organizer and first director (1940-44), and then consultant, of the National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel, which had during the Second World War the responsibility for inventorying and allocating the best minds and most effectively trained individuals that could be recruited for war work. His activities in this post made him particularly sensitive to shortages that might develop in key areas requiring technically and professionally trained individuals. He took to heart the recommendation of a committee of the Roster, headed by Owen D. Young, that colleges should be encouraged to intensify training in all areas where shortages became most acute. Tufts seemed to be in a most favorable situation so far as training in engineering, chemistry, mathematics, physics, medicine, and dentistry were concerned. Certain fields of economics were also of special importance. The only major problem, as the president saw it, was how to channel the talents of those students majoring in the humanities into war work. He suggested that they enroll in one or more "technique" courses so that they would be useful in the war effort. College contracts with the Office of Scientific Research and Development, which was directed by Dr. Vannevar Bush, a distinguished graduate of the Class of 1913, had reached significant proportions by 1942. Two years later, government contracts with the college totaled over half a million dollars. Almost one-half of the funds in 1944 were being used by the Research Laboratory of Sensory Psychology and Physiology, which President Carmichael had organized after his arrival at Tufts and which represented an early example of sponsored research at the college.</p>
							<p>The impact of the Second World War was felt everywhere in the college. The faculty, and many of the students, went on a round-the-clock schedule, beginning in 1942. At the height of the world conflict, during 1943-44, Tufts was not one institution but three. It was simultaneously training service personnel in uniform, educating civilian men and women, and providing educational opportunities for returning servicemen. In order to meet the needs of these diverse groups, the acceleration proceeded in different ways and at differing paces, depending on the needs and facilities of various divisions and departments. In the school of liberal arts and Jackson College, two six-week summer sessions were arranged for 1942. Students enrolling in both sessions could in this way advance by one semester. It was decided in the following year to divide the academic year into three terms of sixteen weeks each, beginning July 1, November 1, and March 1. The faculty was careful to point out at the same time that academic credit would not be granted to students merely because they had served in the armed forces. The College followed the practice used in the First World War of granting War Certificates to students who had been in attendance for two or more semesters and who left to enter the armed forces. The engineering school at first required acceleration for upperclassmen during the summer months so that seniors could graduate in February rather than in June. The medical and dental schools adopted an eleven-month, three-semester academic year. Only the Fletcher School did not plan a formally accelerated program.</p>
							<p>Physical changes and rearrangements were everywhere in evidence. <placeName n="East Hall">East Hall</placeName>, the oldest men's dormitory, was taken over in 1942 for the pilot training program, and sixty men were housed there in eight-week rotation. Part of <placeName n="West Hall">West Hall</placeName>, another men's dormitory, was leased by the federal government as a residence for enlisted men. When the normal resident population jumped from approximately 700 to over 1,200 in a matter of months, new dining and residence facilities had to be provided. Four fraternities on Professors Row became Jackson dormitories. Jackson students, in turn, had been ousted from <placeName n="Stratton Hall">Stratton Hall</placeName> to make way for the Navy, which also occupied three men's dormitories and two fraternity houses. In 1944-45 there were so few civilian male residential students left on the campus that they were all housed in Richardson House, typically a women's dormitory. One fraternity house became the "sick bay" for the Navy, and another served as a dining room for Fletcher students, who found their two dormitories occupied by undergraduate women. Until <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> could be converted into a Navy mess hall, the students in that training contingent had to be served temporarily in the baseball cage of <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName> by a catering firm. An area of rough terrain near the gymnasium became an obstacle or "commando" course for the rigorous physical regimen of the Naval students, and the various playing fields, tennis courts, and the golf course were thronged with classes in calisthenics and related activities. Jackson students were busy with extracurricular "war courses" which included Red Cross First Aid, Air Raid Precautions, and Motor Transport. They helped during the war to collect hundreds of books for donation to the armed forces. Tradition was shattered when the engineering school awarded a degree to a woman in 1943. In the same year Tufts graduated more women than men for the first time in its history. "Victory gardens" sprouted at strategic points about the campus as faculty-turned-farmers vied with one another in setting new production records in everything from radishes to rhubarb.</p>
							<p>When the Board of Trustees met in the autumn of 1942, there were 188 students in uniform on the Hill. A year later, there were approximately 1,000, most of them in the Navy V-12 Program. If the several hundred in the medical and dental schools were counted, over 1,600 men were to be found in some phase of combined academic and military training. Taken together, they outnumbered civilian students by considerably more than two to one. A concerted effort was made to continue regular student activities such as the dramatic society. A combined Navy-civilian student council was organized, musical activities were much in evidence, and the campus newspaper continued to appear. A new publication, Tufts Topics, in the form of a newsletter, was sent all over the world to the more than 4,000 Tufts men and women in service in 1943. The College was placed on the map in another way. Two ships bearing the Tufts name were constructed and launched during the war: the Liberty Ship SS Charles Tufts and the SS Tufts Victory.</p>
							<p>On the home front, intercollegiate athletics continued on a limited scale, and in 1943 Tufts not only was one of the few schools to play a full schedule of football but was able to achieve one of its infrequent victories over Harvard. Tufts resisted the change of policy of many colleges which, because of a shortage of athletic manpower, allowed freshmen to play on Varsity teams. The College managed admirably by replacing curtailed intercollegiate sports such as basketball with an enlarged intramural program. Physical fitness was the order of the day, and during the war both civilian men and women were required to take three hours of physical education per week for all four years. Almost all of the regular faculty taught forty-eight out of the fifty-two weeks, with more hours in the classroom and larger classes. Additional personnel had to be used on the staff of the engineering school to teach mathematics, physics, and engineering drawing.</p>
							<p>An administrative mechanism comparable to the School of War Service was created in 1943-44 to handle returning servicemen; it was known as the School for War Veterans. Like its Naval counterpart, the new agency recommended no degrees and established no curricula. A Veterans Center was established in Braker Hall, and Professor Arthur Leighton became its head. Among his tasks was the advising of returnees and the evaluating of their educational plans as they became eligible for federal aid under Public Law 346 (the so-called "G.I. Bill of Rights") and Public Law 16, for disabled veterans. The School for War Veterans ceased to exist under that name after the war was over, but the reception center for veterans continued, with a peak of activity in 1946-47. It also kept the records of students registered under the Selective Service System. Tufts was also, beginning in 1944, one of the cooperating schools in the Veterans Administration Guidance Center at Harvard. The Center was transferred to Tufts in mid-1948, and Dean Wessell served as its executive officer as well as director of counseling. The facility became the Veterans Counseling Center in 1952 and remained on the campus until themid-1950s. The college thus became one of the many institutions to assist the Veterans Administration in furnishing educational guidance at the college level.</p>
							<p>Even the traditional Commencement ceremonies were affected by the war. The innovation of as many as three special Degree Convocations a year was introduced, in addition to the customary ceremonies in June. Until the custom was abandoned after the last regular Commencement in 1943, orations had been prepared by graduating students selected from among all the divisions of the college except the graduate school and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. After 1943 the institution continued the tradition of having one of the recipients of honorary degrees, usually from outside the Tufts community, deliver the principal address. </p>

							<head>WMFO, 1971</head>
							<p> WMFO began broadcasting on February 6, 1971, as a daily AM radio station. Over the next few years it became a twenty-four hour a day FM station, while being lauded as one of the best college radio stations in Boston.</p>
							<p>WMFO began broadcasting out of the third floor of <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName> as a daily AM station, running a few programs a day, but soon developed enough local interest to switch to the FM band, with ten watts at 91.5 FM. Licensed as an educational radio station, WMFO was required by the FCC to broadcast local and national news and public affairs, and as a result became quite popular in Medford and Somerville. In 1973, with a $1000 grant from the TCU Senate, WMFO broadcast live coverage of the Medford and Somerville elections, including taped interviews with the mayoral candidates.</p>
							<p>In 1974, WMFO finally had enough DJs and funding to begin broadcasting twenty-four hours a day, and began to follow the freeform format that characterizes the station today. Along with newscasts at different points during the day, WMFO played music that would not normally have been heard on popular radio. The weekly WMFO schedule included, for example, a Haitian music program and a Brazilian program. </p>
							<p>On April 2, 1977, WMFO suffered a major setback when fire destroyed most of <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName>. The fire, which was detected while WMFO was on the air, destroyed the entire third floor of Curtis, causing over $100,000 damage to the WMFO studios and destroying 12,000 records. Not to be defeated, however, WMFO was back broadcasting within six hours, going out live from the loft in Eaton Lounge. After a delay of about a week, WMFO set up in the Bolles House until Curtis could be repaired. In that same small period of time, the station had already received over 2500 records and $3200 in donations to restore the studio.</p>
							<p>By the beginning of the fall semester in 1977, repairs to Curtis were complete and WMFO was able to move back in. Over the next few months, WMFO worked to improve their studios, and in early 1978 installed $20,000 worth of new equipment in <placeName n="Curtis Hall">Curtis Hall</placeName>. </p>
							<p>In January of 1982, after a long application process with the FCC, WMFO's request to move from 10 to 125 watts was finally approved. The station upgrade allowed their signal to travel further, increasing the WMFO's potential audience. </p>
							<p>Although WMFO has occasionally faced student accusations that the programming is not always what the campus wants to hear, the station has remained true to its freeform style, and as of 2001 continues to broadcast freeform radio seven days a week. </p>

							<p> Frank G. Wren (1874-1940), A1894, G1897, H1939, was known as the "dean of deans" having held the position of Dean of Liberal Arts at Tufts College for 33 years.</p>
							<p>Wren was born in Sharon, Massachusetts, on March 15, 1874.He attended Dean Academy and graduated from Tufts in 1894.He received his Master of Arts degree from the college in 1897. In 1898, he married Mary E. Ingraham, with whom he had one son, Paul, A1926.</p>
							<p>Wren joined the Tufts faculty as an instructor in mathematics during his senior year of undergraduate study and remained at the college for forty-five years. He was the youngest member of his graduating class, and then, theyoungest member of the faculty when he became dean of Liberal Arts at the age of thirty. At the same time, Wren was appointed to the Walker chair in mathematics. </p>
							<p>During his thirty-three year tenure as dean, the enrollment of the college tripled. He also served for thirty years as chairman of the board of admissions. Wren was a member of the American Academy of Arts and sciences, the American Mathematical Society, Phi Beta Kappa, and Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. He was also a trustee of Dean Academy. Wren died suddenly at his home at 65 Talbot Avenue on July 17, 1940.</p>

							<p> WTCR was a small, student-run radio station that operated out of the basement of Braker Hall from 1956 to 1961.</p>
							<p>On April 13, 1956, a small group of Tufts students began transmitting radio broadcasts from a room in the basement of Braker Hall. Calling the station WTCR, the students established themselves as an official campus organization. By the next year, WTCR's membership had grown to forty students. The station advertised itself as the voice of Tufts Radio Workshop. WTCR served as both a campus radio station, and also a radio workshop for interested students. WTCR became one of the largest and most influential student groups over the next couple of years, eventually expanding their signal so that they were broadcast to nearly all the dorms at Tufts. WTCR's programming included play by play sports, news, and educational broadcasts. </p>
							<p>By late 1959, WTCR was beginning to encounter serious problems. The FCC forced the station to shut down after it discovered radiation leaks at the studio. The station equipment, mostly leftovers from the military, was breaking down and slowly leaking radiation. For the next two years, the station attempted to fix the equipment and continue broadcasting, but aside from a few sports games and news programs, WTCR was basically off the air. The station officially disbanded in 1961. </p>

							<head>Wulsin, Frederick R., 1891-1961</head>
							<p> Frederick R. Wulsin (1891-1961) was a noted anthropologist and a popular professor at Tufts University. </p>
							<p>Wulsin was born on July 8, 1891 in Cincinnati, Ohio. After completing high school in Ohio, Wulsin enrolled at Harvard University, receiving his B.A. in 1913. At his parents' urging, Wulsin returned to Harvard in 1915, and earned a Masters of Civil Engineering. After his graduation, however, Wulsin realized that although he was a trained engineer, he had no desire to work in the engineering field. Instead, he wanted to travel and work as an explorer. </p>
							<p>To pursue his desires, Wulsin traveled to Paris as an employee for a machine tool exporter, and worked there until the beginning of World War I. During the war, he remained in Paris, serving as a lieutenant in the Intelligence Sector of the 42nd Division. After the war, Wulsin participated in several sociological expeditions, traveling to Inner Mongolia, China, and Tibet. After his return, Wulsin traveled by Model T and camel caravan through much of Persia and Africa. Having finally found his calling, Wulsin returned to Harvard and received his Ph. D. in anthropology in 1929. </p>
							<p>For the next few years, Wulsin worked around Boston, tutoring at Harvard and acting as a teaching assistant at Boston University. He also worked for the Peabody Museum, before going to Washington, D.C., to help with the war effort. In Washington, Wulsin stumbled upon a career in teaching almost by accident. Wulsin was working under the Secretary of War to solve problems maintaining troops under extreme conditions, and met Tufts president Leonard Carmichael, who was also working in Washington. Carmichael offered Wulsin a job, and in 1945 Wulsin came to Tufts as a lecturer in Sociology and Anthropology. In 1947, Wulsin was promoted to professor, and was fast becoming one of the most popular professors on campus. Oftentimes during the spring, Wulsin taught classes outside lying on his stomach with his head in one hand. After he stopped teaching introductory anthropology in order to teach some upper level courses, enrollment in the introductory sessions dropped considerably. </p>
							<p>Wulsin continued at Tufts until 1957, when he retired to work on a book about his experiences and theories. Wulsin, a member of various scholarly organizations including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Explorers Club, and the Cosmos Club, died after a long illness on February 26, 1961, in Tucson, Arizona. </p>

							<head>Wyeth House, 1910</head>
							<p> Wyeth House, probably named after donor Edwin Wyeth, was purchased by Tufts Uninversity in 1952 to serve as a Jackson dormitory. </p>
							<p>Built in 1910, Wyeth House served as a private residence until its sale to the university in 1952.During the summer of that year, Wyeth House was completely renovated and converted into a dormitory. Sixteen Jackson undergraduates became Wyeth House's first residents in the fall of 1952. </p>
							<p>Edwin Wyeth, after whom the house is probably named, left $50,000 to the university through a trust fund in the mid-1930s.</p>
							<p>With the completion of new dorms during the 1960s, Wyeth House was converted to serve as the German Culture House. Located on Whitfield Street on the Medford campus, residents enjoy a friendly rivalry with their neighbors in Schmalz House, the French Culture House, located next door. Aside from the Thanksgiving break theft of $1480 worth of student property in 1973, Wyeth House's history has been relatively quiet. </p>
							<p>As of 2000, Wyeth House continues to serve as the German Culture House.</p>

							<head>Zimman, Harold O., 1916-1994</head>
							<p> Harold O. Zimman (1916-1994), A1938, publisher of sports magazines and former member of the United States Olympic Committee, maintained a life-long connection to Tufts as a student athlete, benefactor, and trustee. He was a strong supporter of Tufts athletics, serving on the department's board of overseers and serving as the major benefactor of the Zimman Football Field at Ellis Oval and the Zimman Room of the fitness center in <placeName n="Cousens Gymnasium">Cousens Gymnasium</placeName>, which were both named in his honor.</p>
							<p>Born April 13, 1916, and raised in Lynn, Massachusetts, Zimman graduated from Classical High School in 1934 before entering Tufts College. As an undergraduate, he played on the football teams an offensive lineman, captaining the squad for the 1937 season. After graduating in 1938, Zimman founded H.O. Zimman, Inc., which produced programs for high school and collegiate athletic teams, and printed materials for other sports publications. His company also published the programs for United States Tennis Association (USTA) tournaments, including the US Open. Working with his wife, Helen, Zimman published The Olympian, the United States Olympic Committee's magazine, for almost fifty years.</p>
							<p>Zimman was a strong supporter of the Olympics, serving on the board of directors of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) from 1972-1988. He recognized the need for dialogue with athletes and promoted changes that revolutionized the organization. He also headed both USOC and USTA's public relations committees. He was presented the Olympic Order for meritorious service to the Olympic movement in 1993. The following year, the USTA presented Zimman with the Samuel Hardy Award for long and outstanding service to tennis. He was also instrumental in the founding of Israel's World Maccabiah Games, which are an Olympic-like competitions for Jewish athletes, and the United States Committee, Sports for Israel.</p>
							<p>In 1992, Zimman made it possible for Tufts to present USOC with its successful proposal for the university's Talloires campus to be used as the headquarters of the committee and host families of US Olympians during the winter games at Albertville, France.</p>
							<p>Zimman died of heart failure December 14, 1994, in Beverly, Massachusetts. </p>
